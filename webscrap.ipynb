       "['King’s fortune includes cars, jewellery, property, investments, horses, rare stamps, art and a hereditary estate King Charles III has inherited assets that have propelled his wealth to almost £2bn, according to extensive research and analysis by the Guardian. The monarch’s personal fortune is largely concealed from public scrutiny and it is impossible to know the complete value of his estate. However, the Guardian has conducted the first comprehensive audit of the king’s assets, from country piles and diamond-encrusted jewels, to paintings by Monet and Dalí, Rolls-Royces, racehorses and rare stamps. The research throws into sharp relief the Windsor family’s most valuable financial asset: total immunity from inheritance tax. It has probably allowed Charles to receive his mother’s wealth free of any contribution to the public purse. In a statement the king’s spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on private finances, your figures are a highly creative mix of speculation, assumption and inaccuracy.” Buckingham Palace declined to offer alternative figures; it has a policy of refusing to comment on the personal finances of royals, insisting they should “remain private, as they do for any other individual”.     Cost of the crown is an investigation into royal wealth and finances. The series, published ahead of the coronation of King Charles III, is seeking to overcome centuries of secrecy to better understand how the royal family is funded, the extent to which individual members have profited from their public roles, and the dubious origins of some of their wealth. The Guardian believes it is in the public interest to clarify what can legitimately be called private wealth, what belongs to the British people, and what, as so often is the case, straddles the two. • Read more about the investigation • Fund Guardian investigative journalism that uncovers the secrets of the powerful that we all need to know The research into the king’s assets, however, reveals quite how different they are from those of any other individual. From official state gifts that have been subsumed into private property, to vast hereditary estates that pay out tens of millions each year, much of the king’s private wealth is derived from his and his family’s public roles as working royals. All told, Charles’s private wealth is estimated to total £1.815bn. That figure is three times larger than a recent calculation by the Sunday Times, which did not include several of his most valuable assets. To catalogue the king’s holdings, a team of Guardian reporters worked with 12 experts who are experienced at valuing land, property, vehicles, art and jewellery. For more opaque assets, such as the king’s investments in shares and stocks, we drew on the best available clues to make informed estimates. The king’s private fortune has historically been hidden by a sprawling edifice of secrecy, with laws and judicial decrees employed to shelter their shareholdings and wills from public scrutiny. As a result, investigating the family’s wealth – and the extent to which that wealth is derived from public funds – is challenging. Even defining something as simple as what the king owns can be difficult. While some items are unequivocally his personal property, others are owned “in right of the crown”, an ornate way of saying that they in effect belong to the nation. Some of these publicly owned items, however, such as rare pieces of jewellery or Rolls-Royce cars, appear to be treated, at times, as though they are the personal property of the Windsor family. Buckingham Palace has refused to answer multiple requests to clarify which items fall into which categories. This month the Sunday Times Rich List reported the king’s net worth to be £600m, although it excluded several major asset categories. In 2020 David McClure came to a total of £400m for Queen Elizabeth II’s net worth, for his book. The Queen’s True Worth. In 2001 the Mail on Sunday valued the queen’s private fortune at £1.15bn – the equivalent of £2bn today, if adjusted for inflation. Back in 1989, the royal biographer Andrew Morton estimated the queen’s net worth at £1bn (£2.4bn today). Much of the variation in these estimates can be put down to what is or is not counted as private wealth, and that depends on which definition of “ownership” is used. For McClure, an adept chronicler of royal wealth who died last year, the key test was whether the monarch could sell or dispose of an asset. The Guardian has opted instead for a definition of “beneficial ownership”, a reference to the person who ultimately benefits from an asset. It is more commonly used by those creating or unpicking offshore tax structures, where the true owner of a London mansion or Maltese yacht is insulated by a web of shell corporations or legal structures. Ownership of some of the king’s assets can be similarly opaque, although the devices of obfuscation are ancient royal charters and constitutional quirks rather than offshore trusts The value of the Duchy of Lancaster’s assets is taken from its most recent financial accounts. Further detail on how we estimated other assets are available at the following links: jewels, art, Sandringham Balmoral, horses, cars and stamps. Estimating the king’s shares and investments was the most difficult since so little is known about them. We collected several different figures. Firstly, we started with a report published in the Times in 1993 that suggested the queen had accrued £43m in shares. Assuming those same funds remained invested in FTSE 100 shares, they would now be worth £118m. To account for additional savings after 1993, we assumed that the queen saved money from her annual Duchy of Lancaster payments at the same rate as the average British household (roughly 9% since the early 1960s) and invested it in the FTSE 100. Although highly conservative, that calculation suggests additional savings of £22m. We carried out a similar exercise for the Duchy of Cornwall’s annual payments to Charles. A Downing Street memo from 1969, when Charles was 21, acknowledged his duchy payments were “considerably in excess” of his expenses, allowing him to accrue a “reserve fund”. We assumed that as a child he saved 50% of his payments and, from 1970 onwards, saved at the same rate as the average British household. That exercise brings us to £36m. We made one major deduction, removing £17m from the hypothetical share wealth in 1996 to account for Charles’s divorce payment to Diana, Princess of Wales. All told, Charles’s personal investments, and those presumed to have been inherited from his mother, bring us to an estimate of £142m. The difficulty in disentangling public from private wealth is illustrated by the Windsors’ fleet of Rolls-Royces, Bentleys and Jaguars. The Guardian identified 23 vehicles at the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace and Sandringham, the king’s private estate in Norfolk. Some royal cars are privately owned or loaned to the Windsors by manufacturers. Others are held by the sovereign “in right of the crown”, which means they are not private property but held by the monarch on behalf of the nation. Confusing matters further, vehicles designated “state cars” are sometimes used privately, such as when Princess Eugenie, who has never been a working royal, arrived at her wedding in a “state” 1977 Rolls-Royce Phantom VI worth £1.3m. The palace refused repeated invitations to explain which cars Charles holds for the benefit of the nation and which are privately owned. A conservative calculation, based on expert estimates, of those cars that can safely be assumed to be private, suggests they are worth £6.3m. King Charles has no shortage of palaces, castles and residences to enjoy, but most of them are not technically his. Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace are, for example, owned by the sovereign in right of the crown. However, Charles has inherited from his mother two rural estates that are among his most valuable assets. The first is Balmoral, bought as a Scottish Highlands bolthole by Queen Victoria’s husband, Albert, in 1852. It has served as a Windsor family retreat for over 150 years; the family were there after the sudden death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 and it was also the place where, following her short illness, the queen died in September last year. The estate comprises not only Balmoral Castle but also 21,725 hectares (53,684 acres) of land, including a nearby grouse moor. Considering its potential for forestry, farming, grouse shooting, deer stalking and renewable energy generation, the estate was valued, with the help of an expert, at £80m. Even more valuable is the sprawling Sandringham estate in Norfolk, bought in 1862 by Victoria for her son. Described at the time as “very ugly” and surrounded by “6,000 acres of sand”, it bled cash for decades. That changed when the king’s father, Prince Philip, embarked upon a merciless cost-cutting exercise. The family has since put extensive efforts into monetising the estate; in addition to the manor itself, which tourists can visit for £23, Sandringham has hundreds of rental properties, 6,400 hectares of farmland and commercial lets. With the help of specialists we valued Sandringham conservatively at £250m, taking the total for Scottish and English land and property to £330m. Charles will have paid no inheritance tax on Balmoral or Sandringham because of a highly preferential agreement his mother reached in 1993 with the Conservative government of the then prime minister, John Major. Under the deal, the queen agreed to “voluntarily” pay tax on her private income. But Major allowed bequests between monarchs an exemption from inheritance tax, incentivising the Windsors to funnel all their wealth through the line of succession. That has greatly enriched the king, though to the considerable detriment of his siblings, Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Prince Andrew, who is reportedly “in despair” that he has not received what he believes he is owed. Among the many assets the late queen left to her eldest son, presumably in order to avoid tax payable on bequests to other children, were her horses. An enthusiastic owner and breeder of racehorses, the queen invested untold amounts of time, effort and personal wealth in pursuing what she once described as “a simple philosophy” to breed “a horse faster than other people’s”. The legacy of that lifelong pursuit is about 70 thoroughbreds at various stages of racing and breeding careers, some kept at the Royal Stud at Sandringham. Their total estimated value is at least £27m. Charles has begun liquidating his equine assets; since his mother’s death, he has earned £2.3m from selling horses at auction, including some given to the queen by the Emir of Dubai and the Aga Khan. The palace indicated it regards them as “personal” rather than official gifts. It did not make the same claim about two official gifts, from Canada and Laos, that have been subsumed into the royal family’s private stamp collection. The royal philatelic collection is considered the best stamp collection in the world, and contains hundreds of thousands of stamps, some of which were harvested by Charles’s great-grandfather, George V, from the British Post Office and colonies. The extremely limited access the public has to the collection adds to the complexity in trying to value it. But the consensus among four experts we consulted was that it is worth at least £100m. The palace’s gift policy distinguishes between “official gifts”, which are generally those received in the course of formal duties and functions, and “personal gifts”, from people known personally to royals. The Windsor dynasty is barred from treating official gifts as their private property. The policy adds: “In all cases, and particularly on official overseas trips, organisations and individuals should be discouraged from offering extravagant gifts, ie gifts of high monetary value.” But it stays silent on the vexed question of what should be done with official gifts received before the rules were introduced in 1995. In addition to horses and stamps, these include numerous expensive artworks received by the family on foreign trips that have since turned up in their private collections. Among them are pieces by Marc Chagall and Salvador Dalí that were given to Prince Philip. Both Philip and the king’s grandmother, the queen mother, were avid collectors of art and purchased many pieces at bargain prices that would, if sold today, realise many times the original price tag. They include a Monet bought by the queen mother in Paris shortly after the second world war, when prices were low, for £2,000. An art valuer estimated it could now be worth £20m. We enlisted the help of three art valuers to estimate 60 of the most significant works on a list of almost 400 pieces that have been exhibited in “private” or “personal” royal collections. The total value was £24m. That figure is likely to be a significant underestimate given that it is based on a valuation of only a sample of royal artworks, which are among thousands believed to be in the Windsors’ private collection. The figure also does not take into account the “premium” some buyers might pay for items previously owned by British royals. Applying such a premium to artworks was considered too difficult. However, it is indisputably the case that an object’s value at auction can increase dramatically because of its royal provenance. That phenomenon is most pronounced when it comes to the Windsors’ private collection of precious gems and jewellery. Queen Mary, Elizabeth II’s grandmother, was mesmerised by jewellery and acquired the bulk of what now constitutes the royal family’s private collection. Several of the best-known items were valued in 1989 by the jewellery expert Laurence Krashes for a book by the journalist Andrew Morton. The Guardian secured valuations of several additional pieces from the private jewellery merchant Sara Abey. However, none of those valuations account for any markup that jewels previously owned or worn by the Windsors would inevitably attract. Morton speculated that the premium would multiply their inherent value tenfold. Seventeen years later, there was a real-world precedent suggesting that was an underestimate. In 2006 an auction of jewellery belonging to Princess Margaret resulted in items fetching an average of 18 times more than their upper estimate. Part of the proceeds had to be diverted to charity after it emerged that some of the items were official gifts. The auction revealed just how much some buyers would pay for necklaces and brooches once worn or owned by the Windsors. For the sake of caution, we opted for Morton’s more conservative premium of 10 times the intrinsic value. That gives 54 privately owned jewels a value of £533m. No aspect of the Windsor family’s wealth is more secret than its shares and investments, making it impossible to value the assets with any certainty. For decades royal investments were concealed by a shell company that, archives reveal, was created in order to shelter the queen’s “embarrassing” private wealth from public scrutiny. But there are some clues about the size of their shareholdings. In 1993 journalists at the Times scoured the share registers of FTSE 100 companies to find their holdings, reporting that around £43m of them were believed to be held by the monarch. If those funds remained invested in FTSE 100 companies, the same investments would be worth £118m today. The monarch and heir to the throne also receive tens of millions of pounds in “private income” annually from hereditary estates. Had they saved at the same rate as the average British household, and invested the money in FTSE 100 firms, the king and his mother would have accrued an extra £58m between them. Deducting £17m for the reported divorce payment Charles made to Diana in 1996, we estimate the family’s total share wealth to be £142m. That, too, is likely to be a significant underestimate given it is based on what the average British household saved from its income – approximately 9% in recent decades. Rich people such as the royals have considerably more disposable cash and, as a result, tend to put much more in investments. One adviser who specialises in handling the financial affairs of the super-rich, said he would expect a family with the finances of the Windsors to be investing 50% of their income. That the king has such a reliable source of supplementary “private” income can be explained by the real cash cow in his portfolio. The Duchy of Lancaster, a land and property estate that is run as a profitable business, provides whoever sits on the throne with lucrative annual payments of around £20m a year. The inclusion of the estate in a tally of the king’s private fortune will be contentious among republicans, who have long argued it should be a public asset. Created by royal charter hundreds of years ago, the estate has for centuries been the subject of a heated debate about whether its profits should be paid to the Treasury. Instead, it is passed down through successive monarchs, who are restricted from selling off the assets for cash. The palace calls the duchy a “a private estate held in trust for the sovereign” although it is an entity like no other. The arcane model is somewhat analogous to offshore trusts that create the appearance of distance between an asset and its true owner. But the duchy’s financial intricacies cannot mask the fact that it only has one beneficial owner. Search for Duchy of Lancaster subsidiaries in the corporate register and the person of significant control is listed as “his majesty the king”. To all intents and purposes, the duchy functions as a private asset of the monarch: in the five years leading up to her death it paid the late queen £109m. Its accounts declare assets of £653m, bringing the tally of Charles’s wealth to £1.8bn.

       " \"Continent set for further drought in 2023, scientists say, as unstoppable impacts of climate crisis mount The climate crisis had “frightening” impacts in Europe last year, with heatwaves killing more than 20,000 people and drought withering crops, an EU report has found. Its writers said drought was already baked in for many farmers in 2023. The only way to limit the rising damages of global heating was rapidly to cut carbon emissions, they said. The report, from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said widespread heatwaves had led to Europe suffering its hottest summer on record in 2022, by a large margin. These would have been virtually impossible without global heating and had led to many premature deaths. People in southern Europe endured 70-100 days of heat stress, where the temperature felt like at least 32C, accounting for wind and other factors. In the UK, temperatures passed 40C for the first time. The heat, plus low rainfall, caused drought that affected more than a third of the continent at its peak, the report said, making it the driest year on record. Flows in almost two-thirds of Europe’s rivers were lower than average. High temperatures also meant that the carbon emissions from summer wildfires were the highest in 15 years and the European Alps lost record amounts of ice from glaciers. Overall, Europe experienced its second-warmest year ever recorded, with temperatures rising at twice the global average rate – faster than on any other continent. Over the past five years, the average temperature has been 2.2C higher than in the pre-industrial era. One bright spot in the report was that Europe received its highest amount of solar radiation in 40 years, owing to lower cloud cover, enabling above-average levels of solar-power generation. “The findings are frightening, I have to say, but I think we have to know the truth,” said Mauro Facchini, head of earth observation at the European Commission. “We have more and more extreme events happening in Europe. Every one of us can witness that.” Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said: “We are really moving into an uncharted territory.” The report should be seen as “yet another wake-up call to accelerate our efforts” to cut carbon emissions, which also hit record levels in 2022, he said. Scientists recently predicted that the imminent return of the El Niño climate phenomenon would cause global temperatures to rise “off the chart”. Dr Rebecca Emerton, the lead author of the C3S report, said: “We cannot stop these climate impacts – we can only limit [them] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly.” She said a dry winter and spring in 2023 meant more drought was on the way. “Unfortunately, the impacts are probably already in place for the growing season, so we’re likely to see reduced crop production this year,” she said. Without global heating, droughts such as the record northern hemisphere drought in 2022 would have been expected only once every four centuries. Prof Daniela Schmidt, at the University of Bristol, UK, said: “We are clearly not prepared for droughts like we have seen in the last year, given the losses in agriculture, scorched plants and fish in dwindling rivers. We need to invest to adapt.” Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion The C3S report also examined the Arctic and said Greenland had experienced record-breaking ice-sheet melt during exceptional heatwaves in September, when average temperatures were up to 8C higher than average. A separate report, also published on Thursday, showed that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets had lost ice every year since polar satellite records began in 1992, with the seven worst melting years all occurring in the past decade. The melting drives up sea levels and coastal flooding across the planet. The study, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, found that the polar ice sheets lost 7.6tn tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2020, equivalent to a giant ice cube 12 miles (20km) in height. Scientists predict that if the ice sheets continue to melt at this pace, they will contribute between 15cm and 27cm to global sea level rise by 2100. Prof Andrew Shepherd, at Northumbria University, UK, said: “We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet [loss] as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately.”\",\n",

Denmark’s acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said they were not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul, saying that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has claimed that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia captured last year, will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying. A flash in the sky over Kyiv prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite re-entering the atmosphere, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time and shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”.

Switzerland will add the private military Wagner group and news agency RIA to its list of Russian sanctioned entities, Reuters reports the Swiss department of economic affairs, education and research said on Thursday. Hungary has banned imports of honey and certain meat products in addition to grains from Ukraine until 30 June, the prime minister’s chief of staff said on Thursday, increasing pressure on Brussels to broaden proposed European Union-wide measures. The European Commission said on Wednesday it would take emergency “preventive measures” for wheat, maize, sunflower seeds and rapeseed after some central European countries took unilateral steps to ban imports of food products from Ukraine to protect their own agricultural sectors. However, Hungary and Poland have said that other products should also be included. Reuters reports Gergely Gulyás said the Hungarian ban on imports of major cereals and agricultural products “includes a total of 25 products, the most important of which are cereals, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, flour, oil, honey and certain meat products”. Agriculture minister István Nagy told state news agency MTI on Wednesday that Hungary will continue to allow transit of Ukrainian grain, ensuring the departure of such shipments “in a controlled manner”. “It was worthwhile for Hungary to take firm action and protect the interests of Hungarian farmers,” he said, referring to the ban, adding the measures forced Brussels to take action.

The ad, set to imposing rock music, follows a report from British military intelligence and Russian media reports that suggest Moscow is seeking to recruit up to 400,000 professional soldiers – on a volunteer basis – to bolster its forces in Ukraine. The ad has so far been released on major Russian social networking sites. It invites men to sign a contract with the Russian defence ministry for a salary starting at 204,000 roubles (£2,000 / $2,495) a month, and begins by showing a man in a supermarket dressed in military uniform holding a heavy machine gun. He is then shown instead in the uniform of a supermarket security guard with the question: “Is this the kind of defender you dreamed of becoming?” Next in the video, a man is walking through the fog with other soldiers on what looks like a battlefield. He is then shown as a gym instructor helping a client lift weights. “Is this really where your strength lies?” the video asks, before cutting to a taxi driver taking a client’s fare who then transforms into a soldier on the battlefield. “You’re a man. Be one,” the ad concludes. After launching a partial mobilisation drive in September which prompted tens of thousands of Russian men to flee the country to avoid being drafted, the authorities are playing down the possibility of a second mobilisation call – despite a recent move to introduce electronic call-up papers to clamp down on draft dodgers – and are seeking to recruit volunteers instead. Posters seeking professional soldiers have sprung up in the Russian capital in recent weeks declaring: “Our profession is to defend the Motherland.” Reuters reports the posters, which say the army is looking for gunners, sappers, military medics, drivers and tank commanders, promise potential recruits “respect, an honourable profession and decent pay”. DR, Denmark’s public broadcaster, is reporting that foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and acting defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen have said the 14 Leopard 2 tanks being donated by the Netherlands and Denmark could be with Ukraine in early 2024. Poulsen is quoted as saying they are not Danish tanks, but tanks “which are bought in collaboration with the Netherlands”. Rasmussen described it as “a very significant contribution”. A quick snap is breaking across Danish news sources, citing the Ritzau news agency, that Denmark, together with the Netherlands, is to donate 14 Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. More details soon … Pakistan has placed its first order for discounted Russian crude oil under a new deal struck between Islamabad and Moscow, the country’s petroleum minister said, with one cargo to dock at Karachi port in May. The deal will see Pakistan buy crude oil only, not refined fuels, and imports are expected to reach 100,000 barrels a day if the first transaction goes through smoothly, minister Musadik Malik told Reuters on Wednesday night. Russian state-owned news agency Tass has posted on its official Telegram channel to state that “inspections of vessels under the grain deal resumed on 19 April and are scheduled for 20 April”. It cited Ismini Palla, spokesperson for the UN office at the joint coordination centre for the deal in Istanbul. The Donetsk People’s Republic, the Russian-imposed authority in Ukraine’s occupied Donetsk region, has posted on one of its Telegram channels to claim that overnight a woman has been killed in the city of Donetsk by shelling from Ukrainian armed forces. It said the woman, born in 1968, died when a private residential building was hit. The claims have not been independently verified. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, which Russia captured last year, will stop using US-produced nuclear fuel as quickly as possible, the Interfax news agency quoted a Russian official as saying on Thursday. Reuters reports Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the general director of Russian nuclear energy firm Rosenergoatom, which is now in charge of the occupied plant, told Interfax it had about four years’ worth of US-made fuel in reserves. But the Russian management will seek to replace that fuel with the Russian one as quickly as possible as it considers its own technologies superior, he said. A flash in the sky over the Ukrainian capital prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite re-entering the atmosphere, AFP reports, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, Sergiy Popko, wrote on Telegram. An air raid alert was activated, Popko said, but “air defence was not in operation”. Shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. But a Nasa spokesperson denied this assessment, telling the AFP news agency that the satellite in question was “still in orbit”. The US space agency had announced earlier this week that a retired 300kg satellite would re-enter the atmosphere some time on Wednesday. “However, that re-entry has not yet occurred … No other Nasa satellite re-entered the atmosphere earlier today,” a Nasa spokesperson told AFP. The ISW reports that the changes may be a way for the Kremlin to “conduct an overhaul of the domestic security apparatus to oust officials who have fallen out of Kremlin favour and consolidate further control internal security organs”. Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, seems to be conducting “a large-scale overahaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today.

Russian state-controlled outlet TASS reported on 19 April that the FSB and the Main Directorate of the Security Service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) have been conducting mass checks at the Moscow Central District Internal Affairs Directorate and several Moscow district police offices for the past several weeks due to “the leakage of data from Russian security forces at the request of Ukrainian citizens.” … Russian outlets reported that the suspected police officers leaked personal data on Russian security forces to external individuals, some of whom are Ukrainian citizens. The reported FSB and MVD raids on the Moscow police departments are occurring against the backdrop of a series of arrests and dismissals of prominent members of Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard) leadership. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top story this morning: Russia’s federal security service, the FSB, appears to be conducting “a large-scale overahaul of domestic security organs,” the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, reports in its update today. The overhaul appears to be related to leaks of data to Ukraine, the ISW reports. More on this shortly. Here are the other key recent developments in the war: Ukraine has received two types of air defence system ahead of the Ramstein military group meeting on Thursday, where it will ask for more supplies. A Patriot air defence system delivery was confirmed by the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, on Wednesday. The second of four promised German Iris-T system were also delivered, according to a German newspaper which had spoken to government officials. No official announcements have been made. The United States announced $325m in new military aid for Ukraine, including additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, advanced missiles and anti-tank mines. It is the 36th security package since the war began in February 2022. The European Commission is proposing €100m (£88m) in compensation for EU farmers affected by the recent influx of Ukrainian grain as well as restrictions on selling wheat and maize in affected countries, in a move to calm tensions with central and eastern Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the commission, has written to the leaders of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, setting out support measures after four of those countries banned the import or sale of grain and other food products inside their borders earlier this week. Bulgaria had confirmed its temporary halt on Wednesday. Inspections of ships are resuming after a two-day hiatus under a UN-brokered agreement on the safe export of grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, said on Wednesday. A Ukrainian military spokesperson accused Moscow of a “provocation” after Russian proxy forces said Ukrainian forces had blown up four buildings in the eastern city of Bakhmut, killing 20 civilians. The spokesperson said Ukrainian forces never target civilians. Russia also denies targeting civilians. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Wednesday during a visit to Sweden that the US looks forward to welcoming Sweden as a Nato member before the alliance’s summit in July, and will encourage Turkey and Hungary to ratify accession. Along with Finland, Sweden applied to join Nato in May last year. Finland’s application was processed in record time and it became the 31st member of the alliance earlier this month. A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of several Nordic countries alleges that Russia has established a programme using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels aimed at giving it the capability to attack windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea. The Kremlin critic Ilya Yashin has lost an appeal against what his supporters say was a politically motivated decision to jail him for eight and a half years – in a case that has echoes of Monday’s jailing of Vladimir Kara-Murza. The former Moscow councillor’s appeal was rejected as authorities continue to repress freedoms in Russia, with independent media shut down and leading opposition figures behind bars or in exile. Russia has said it summoned the UK ambassador Deborah Bronnert on Tuesday after she criticised the 25-year jail term given to Kara-Murza. She spoke to reporters outside Moscow city court alongside the US and Canadian ambassadors, describing the sentence as “shocking” and called for Kara-Murza, who holds joint UK and Russian citizenship, to be released immediately. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Volyn region of Ukraine, which borders with Belarus and Poland, where he praised the work of border guards. Russian drones struck Ukraine’s southern Odesa region overnight and caused a fire at an infrastructure facility, the head of the military command of the Odesa region, Yuri Kruk, said on Wednesday. No casualties have been reported and firefighters were working at the scene, he said.\",\n",

Rishi Sunak has received the report into the allegations that Dominic Raab bullied officials and is “carefully considering” its findings, Downing Street has said. The Tony Blair Institute has said the new amendments to the illegal migration bill being proposed by the government (see 9.35am) won’t make the legislation any more practical. In a statement, Harvey Redgrave, the thinktank’s immigration specialist, said: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The asylum system is broken and we have yet to see a workable government plan to fix it. Internal Tory debate on the illegal migration bill won’t address its fundamental flaws. Without return agreements the pledge that nobody coming over the Channel will be able to claim asylum is undeliverable. And while the government will try to portray these new amendments as tough, we already know the prime minister is unwilling to take the UK out of the ECHR. Doing so would shatter our reputation and amongst other things undermine the Windsor framework. As TBI has previously said, if the government is serious about preventing illegal migration then they should focus on clearing the backlog, increasing the number of returns, introducing a system of digital identity verification and opening up safe and viable routes for asylum claims. Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, told MPs this morning that the final day of debate on the illegal migration bill will take place on Wednesday next week. That is when the new amendments (see 9.35am) will be debated. Today’s announcement by the Association of School and College Leaders that it is to hold a formal ballot for national strike action for the first time in its history (see 9.49am) marks a significant development in the ongoing dispute between teachers and the government. Up until now only members of the National Education Union (NEU) have taken strike action in England, with five more days of strikes planned for later this term. In addition a fresh ballot is to be held to provide the NEU with a mandate for further strike action up until Christmas. ASCL, which represents many traditionally more cautious and conservative secondary school heads, was the only one of the four main education unions to hold off from a formal ballot last year over teacher pay erosion. Their decision to now go ahead after 87% of voting members rejected the government’s latest pay offer, on a turnout of 56%, marks the growing frustration and strength of feeling across the entire sector. The government offer of a £1,000 non-consolidated payment for 2022-3 and an average 4.5% rise for 2023-4 has been rejected by all the education unions and the prospect of further disruption in schools involving more unions is growing. While earlier ballots failed to reach the required threshold under strike legislation, the NASUWT teachers’ union has already warned the government it plans to ballot members over strike action and the National Association of Head Teachers is considering taking a similar step. Easter recess is over and it’s the first FMQs session for new leader Humza Yousaf since the arrest of two key SNP figures as part of the ongoing police investigation into the party’s finances. It’s also the first session since presiding officer Alison Johnstone introduced strict new entry requirement for members of the public wanting to view FMQs from the chamber gallery, following weeks of disruption by climate protesters. One way or another, climate is on the agenda today, after a new report from the Audit Commission found that the Scottish government’s plans to tackle global heating were “vague” and risked missing its own targets for reducing emissions to net zero by 2045, originally set by Yousaf’s predecessor Nicola Sturgeon. Liz Kendall, the shadow social care minister, has told ITV that the Dominic Raab bullying report should have been published more quickly, and that Raab should have been suspended while the inquiry was being carried out. \\'Why has it taken five months, why hasn\\'t he been suspended in the meanwhile, these are serious allegations\\'Labour\\'s @leicesterliz criticises Rishi Sunak\\'s handling of bullying allegations made about Dominic Raab, as a report into the claims is expected imminently pic.twitter.com/6yXWg9ItRx The government has said it will not hold talks with junior doctors about pay, and how to resolve the dispute that has led to strikes, until the British Medical Association “moves significantly from its unrealistic position of demanding a 35% pay increase”. But this morning Prof Philip Banfield, chairman of the BMA council, insisted that 35% was not “set in stone” as its demand. He told the Today programme: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}People are tied up on this 35% figure. There is no number that is set in stone here, it is the principle of restoring pay that has been lost in its value. In order to discuss what that means and how that is achieved, it needs people to sit around the table. This government does not want to sit around the table. It does not want to have any kind of independent arbitration of this because it’s worried that it might cost it money. The BMA has been calling for a 35% pay rise for junior doctors because it says this is what would be required to return their pay to the level it was in 2008. But it has also said 35% is not a precondition for talks. Banfield in the Today programme responding to a call from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges for the dispute between the government and junior doctors to be referred to an independent arbitrator, like Acas. The BMA has backed this idea, but the government has said it does not want to involve a third party. Rishi Sunak is expected to receive the report into the Dominic Raab bullying allegations later this morning, my colleague Aubrey Allegretti reports. I\\'m told the Dominic Raab report is now nailed on for arriving today.Expectation in Downing Street is PM will get it around 11:30am - so when we see the findings and response depends on how long he takes to make a decision. Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has used an article in the Spectator to dismiss claims that her recent comment about people in UK grooming gangs being mostly British-Pakistani were racist, or wrong. Even Tories were alarmed by her language. In the Spectator she says: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The pursuit of truth is a good lodestar for the right policies. If we are to address the injustice of the grooming gangs scandal we must be willing to acknowledge the role that ethnicity played in covering it up. To say the overwhelming majority of perpetrators in towns such as Rotherham, Telford and Rochdale were British-Pakistani and that their victims were white girls is not to say that most British-Pakistanis are perpetrators of sexual abuse. The former is a truth, one that made authorities reluctant to confront the issue. The latter is a lie, the speaking of which would be a disgraceful prejudice. I know that my motives will be questioned – such is a politician’s lot. But there are lines that we must not cross. If everything is racist, nothing is. Casually accusing me of racism for speaking plain truths distorts the meaning of the term, and does a great disservice to all of us working to combat racism … There is something peculiar about this political moment, where those of us advancing unfashionable facts are beaten over the head with fashionable fictions. I suppose the ethnicity of grooming gang perpetrators in a string of cases is the sort of fact that has simply become unfashionable in some quarters. Like the fact that 100% of women do not have a penis. But Braverman is defending something she did not actually say. No one accused her of saying that most British-Pakistanis are child abusers, and no one disputes that some of the biggest grooming scandals in recent years involved British-Pakistanis. What was objectionable about Braverman’s comment, in an article for the Mail on Sunday, was that all grooming gangs were largely British-Pakistani. She said: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}There are four critical facts about the grooming gangs phenomenon. Each must be acknowledged and addressed in turn if we are to eradicate these gangs and bring justice to their victims … Second, the perpetrators are groups of men, almost all British-Pakistani, who hold cultural attitudes completely incompatible with British values. They have been left mostly unchallenged both within their communities and by wider society, despite their activities being an open secret. This is wrong. The Home Office itself published a report in 2020 saying “research has found that group-based CSE [child sexual exploitation] offenders are most commonly white”. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) has said it will hold a formal ballot for national strike action in England for the first time in its history “over the school funding crisis, the erosion of teacher and leader pay and conditions, and consequent staff shortages which are undermining the education system”. The union’s executive committee of senior elected members met yesterday afternoon and unanimously decided to move to a formal ballot on strike action, PA Media reports. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the ASCL, said: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}ASCL has never before formally balloted at a national level and this is clearly a very significant step. The fact that we have reached this point reflects the desperate situation regarding inadequate funding, long-term pay erosion, teacher shortages, and the intransigence of a government which we can only conclude does not value the education workforce or recognise the severe pressures facing the sector. We have made every effort to resolve this matter through negotiations prior to reaching this point. Unfortunately, the government’s offer has failed to sufficiently address pay and conditions, and, critically, did not provide enough funding for even the meagre proposal it put forward. Following the rejection of the offer by all education unions involved – ASCL, NAHT, NEU and NASUWT – the government has made no effort to reopen negotiations and has said only that the issue of pay will now revert to the school teachers’ review body. The conclusion of the executive committee is that the government has left us with no option other than to conduct a formal ballot for national strike action. The ballot will be held during the summer term at a date to be decided and if members opt to strike, the union said action would be expected to take place during the autumn term of the next school year, PA reports. In an article for its website, Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor, says most people in government assume Dominic Raab will resign, or be sacked, when the report into the bullying allegations about him is published. Mason says: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Speaking to senior folk in government privately, most assume that Mr Raab – who is also justice secretary – is “toast” as one figure put it to me. “The breadth of this, the number of people complaining, surely he can’t survive?” said another. “He’s got to be done for, so many people think he’s a nightmare,” one minister told me. “How does he go home to his wife and kids when there have been so many headlines about him about this stuff?” another said. “To his credit, mind you, he manages to. He’s been getting on with things.” The government’s illegal migration bill, which will stop people arriving in the UK illegally from ever claiming asylum here and allow them to be detained and deported, was already billed as the toughest piece of immigration legislation introduced for decades. Now it is about to get tougher. The bill is due to have its final day of debate in the Commons next week and, according to a report by Matt Dathan in the Times which has been confirmed by government sources, the government will accept two amendments that would significantly tighten its already-draconian provisions (which ministers have accepted might prove incompatible with the European convention on human rights). Dathan writes: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The government has agreed to amend its illegal migration bill to allow ministers to ignore interim injunctions from the European court of human rights that attempt to stop a deportation flight. Known as rule 39 orders, they have been branded “pyjama injunctions” by Conservative MPs after a judge from the Strasbourg court suspended the first scheduled deportation flight to Rwanda last June late at night. The government had previously only committed itself to introducing the power to ignore last-minute injunctions if ministers failed to persuade the Strasbourg court to reform rule 39 orders. A second concession offered to the rebels will also prevent UK courts from granting injunctions to stop migrants being deported, apart from in very limited circumstances. The Home Office has agreed to amend the bill to ensure that the only way in which a migrant who arrives illegally can avoid being removed from the UK will be by proving they face a “real risk of serious and irreversible harm” in the territory to which they are being deported. These amendments are a concession to around 60 Tory backbenchers, led by Danny Kruger and Sir Bill Cash, who want to stop the government being constrained by the ECHR. It is thought that Suella Braverman, the home secretary, largely supports what they are trying to do. THE TIMES: Judges lose power to block migrant flights #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/zjQjWtcZGE Another group of Tories on the liberal wing of the party have been calling for amendments to the bill to protect child migrants and establish more safe and legal routes for asylum seekers hoping to come to the UK. According to Dathan, there will be a concession to them too. He reports: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The Home Office is expected to bring forward an amendment that would commit it to publishing its plan for new legal routes for refugees within six months of the bill passing into law. It is also about to make a commitment to introduce stringent safeguards to protect unaccompanied child refugees. Rajeev Syal and Nadeem Badshah have more on the concessions here. This morning Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, a former lord chief justice and a crossbench member of the House of Lords, said that allowing the government to ignore rule 39 orders would be an “immensely serious step” and one that “sets an extraordinarily bad example”. These interim injunctions do not “in any way detract from the importance of a judgment being made by a court”, he said in an interview with the Today programme. Thomas said that, when the bill went to the Lords, peers were likely to object this provision because it would amount to allowing the government to ignore the rule of law. He told Today. .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Many people would say having the power to ignore a court order is something – unless the circumstances were quite extraordinary – this is a step a government should never take because it is symbolic of a breach of the rule of law. Good morning. After months of waiting, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, seems likely to find out today whether he will be sacked over the claims that he bullied civil servants. The outcome of the investigation into those allegations is expected to be published today, alongside the decision from Rishi Sunak as to what will happen next. As Aubrey Allegretti, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, if Raab is cleared, some civil servants working in the Ministry of Justice are expected to resign.

       " 'Merchants were handing out money from Ramadan when rebels tried to control crowd by shooting in the air, say witnesses  A crowd apparently scared by gunfire and an electrical explosion ran in panic at an event to hand out money during Ramadan in Yemen’s capital late on Wednesday, with the resulting crush killing at least 78 people and injuring at least 73 others, according to witnesses and Houthi rebel officials. The tragedy was Yemen’s deadliest in years that was not related to its long-running war, and came ahead of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan this week. Armed Houthis fired into the air in an attempt at crowd control, apparently striking an electrical wire and causing an explosion, according to two witnesses, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed and Yahia Mohsen. That sparked a panic, and people including many women and children, began running, they said. Video posted on social media showed dozens of bodies, some motionless, and others screaming as people tried to help. Separate footage of the aftermath released by Houthi officials showed bloodstains, shoes and victims’ clothing scattered on the ground. Investigators were seen examining the area. The crush took place in the Old City in the center of Sana’a, where hundreds of poor people had gathered for a charity event organised by merchants, according to the Houthi-run interior ministry. People had gathered to receive about $10 each from a charity funded by local businesses, witnesses said. Wealthy people and businesses often hand out cash and food, especially to the poor, during Ramadan. Abdel-Khaleq al-Aghri from the interior ministry blamed the crush on the “random distribution” of funds without coordination with local authorities. Motaher al-Marouni, a senior health official, said 78 people were killed, according to the rebels’ al-Masirah satellite TV channel. At least 73 others were injured and taken to the al-Thowra Hospital in Sana’a, according to hospital deputy director Hamdan Bagheri. The rebels quickly sealed off a school where the event was being held and barred people, including journalists, from approaching. The interior ministry said it had detained two organisers and an investigation was under way. The Houthis said they would pay about $2,000 in compensation to each family who lost a relative while the injured would get about $400. Yemen’s capital has been under the control of the Iranian-backed Houthis since they descended from their northern stronghold in 2014 and removed the internationally recognised government. That prompted a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in 2015 to try to restore the government. The conflict has turned in recent years into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, killing more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. More than 21 million people in Yemen, or two-thirds of the country’s population, need help and protection, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Among those in need, more than 17 million are considered particularly vulnerable. In February the UN said it had raised only $1.2bn out of a target of $4.3bn at a conference aimed at generating funds to ease the humanitarian crisis. With Reuters',\n",
       " 'Brady ad features US navy veteran’s shocking account of Vietnam gunfire and comes on heels of several devastating mass shootings A gun safety group has created a provocative new ad campaign calling for the renewal of a federal assault weapons ban, in the wake of several devastating mass shootings across the US that involved the use of military-style rifles. The ad, released on Thursday by the gun safety group Brady and shared exclusively with the Guardian, features a US navy veteran of the Vietnam war reading a chilling account of coming under gunfire and being struck by a bullet. “I remember someone picking me up as they ran. They put me down on the floor and covered me with blankets,” the veteran says in the ad. “Someone was screaming – took me a moment to realize it was me. But I survived.” The veteran then reveals that the writer of those words was not a fellow service member but Josh Stepakoff, who was six years old when a mass shooter attacked his Jewish community center in 1999. The ad ends with the message, “Assault weapons belong in war zones, not our communities. Ban assault weapons.” The campaign also includes images showing a casket draped in an American flag, an honor given to soldiers killed in battle, in everyday places that have been the site of mass shootings, such as schools and grocery stores. “These weapons and their tactical features are designed for the battlefield and not for civilian hands,” said Christian Heyne, Brady’s vice-president of policy. “These are not scenarios that exist in the rest of the industrialized world. This ad is really attempting to sort of tell that story in a powerful way.” According to a Politico-Morning Consult poll taken in late January, 65% of US voters support banning assault-style weapons while 26% oppose the policy. Heyne suggested that the ad could help viewers better understand the very real ramifications of this policy debate. “As advocates, this is one of our chief goals, to connect with people in an emotional way,” Heyne said. “We’ve got to break through a lot of this noise and remind people that what we’re talking about is very clearly and very simply that weapons of war are tearing our communities apart.” Brady’s push for the renewal of the 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, comes just weeks after another school shooting devastated a US community and reinvigorated calls for action to address gun violence. Last month, a shooter wielding an AR-15 military-style rifle attacked the Covenant school in Nashville, killing three children and three adults. The shooting prompted Joe Biden to once again call on Congress to pass a federal assault weapons ban. “We’ve continued to see Republican officials across America double down on dangerous bills that make our schools, places of worship and communities less safe,” Biden said earlier this month. “Congress must ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage of firearms, eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and require background checks for all gun sales, and state officials must do the same.” Last year, House Democrats managed to pass a bill banning assault weapons, but the proposal stalled in the Senate. Now that Republicans control the House, Democrats’ chances of passing the bill during this session of Congress are virtually nonexistent. But gun safety groups have seen progress at the state level; Washington is expected to soon enact an assault weapons ban, becoming the 10th US state to do so. Still, gun safety advocates hope to see action at the federal level, and they point to data suggesting an assault weapons ban could help make mass shootings less deadly and may even prevent them from happening. One analysis released in 2019 found that mass-shooting fatalities were 70% less likely to occur when the federal assault weapons ban was in effect, while another study from 2021 concluded that the ban prevented 11 public mass shootings between 1994 and 2004. The data underscores the urgent need to take action against assault weapons at the federal level, Heyne said. He said inaction is no longer an option. “The answer can’t be to just put our hands up in the air and to do nothing. If we want to stop the reality that we’re living in, it will require proactive steps to accomplish it,” Heyne said. “Our leaders should have the courage to protect the most vulnerable among us.”',\n",
       " 'His position has been shaped by Republican losses in the midterm elections but could provide an opening for political rivals Donald Trump considers a federal abortion ban as a losing proposal for Republicans as the party prepares to enter the first presidential election since the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade and is unlikely to support such a policy, according to people close to him. The former president has told allies in recent days that his gut feeling remains leaving the matter of reproductive rights to the states – following the court’s reasoning in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization that ended 50 years of federal abortion protections. But Trump’s crystallizing stance appears to be, in essence, a recognition that a federal abortion ban could cost him in the 2024 election should he become the Republican nominee, mainly because a majority of Americans simply do not support making abortion mostly or entirely illegal. The thinking is informed in part by Republicans’ losses in the midterm elections they were supposed to dominate, which interviews showed were tied to the supreme court ruling. And in the six states where abortion-related questions were on the ballot in 2022, voters chose to reject further limits. The issue has emerged as an early litmus test for Republican presidential candidates, and Trump’s reluctance to endorse national restrictions would put him squarely at odds with prominent leaders of the anti-abortion movement who are demanding federal action. Yet his refusal to embrace the most hard-line position of party activists provides an opening for potential rivals such as Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and his former vice-president, Mike Pence, to run to his right on an issue. Worried about the political risks of being viewed as over draconian on abortion, Trump’s allies told him that they were surprised last week to see DeSantis, his expected rival in the 2024 race, sign into law and become the face of the state’s six-week abortion ban. The feedback to Trump – which is shaping his stance – was that for all the claims by DeSantis that he was supposedly an electable alternative to Trump for the GOP nomination, the Florida governor would undermine his chances in general elections by becoming the face of a six-week abortion ban. Trump has talked about striking a balance, people close to him said: leaving abortion up to the states, while endorsing exceptions for rape, incest and in cases of harm to the mother, as well as appointing conservative judges to the federal bench and removing federal funds for planned parenthood, which he did as president. Trump’s less extreme stance on abortion underscores the enduring potency of one of America’s most politically charged issues. But his posturing could prove risky in the Republican primary, where social conservatives have outsized influence in the early-voting states, especially in Iowa. On Saturday, Trump is scheduled to speak at Iowa’s Faith and Freedom Coalition event – one of the most conservative conferences in the country – where he may be pressed on his abortion stance. Asked about Trump’s stance on abortion for 2024, the campaign reiterated his White House policies. “President Trump believes that the supreme court, led by the three justices which he supported, got it right when they ruled this is an issue that should be decided at the state level.” “Republicans have been trying to get this done for 50 years, but we were unable to do so. President Trump, who is considered the most pro-life president in history, got it done. He will continue these policies when re-elected to the White House,” the statement said. Trump’s political thinking was also on display when the draft supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade was leaked last year, the people said, when he turned to friends and said it would anger suburban women and lead to a backlash against Republicans in the midterms. He initially demurred about taking credit for the ruling – unusual for someone typically so keen to claim any credit – and was silent even as his former vice-president Mike Pence and other conservatives from his administration declared victory for the anti-abortion movement. Later, Trump made sure to issue a statement applauding himself for sticking with his three nominees to the supreme court, who all ended up in the 6-3 majority opinion reversing Roe v Wade. “Today’s decision … only made possible because I delivered everything as promised,” he said. Trump has described himself as the “most pro-life president” in history, though he is also a former Democrat from New York who once supported abortion rights until around the time that he ran for president in 2016. While in office, Trump paved the way for the post-Roe legal landscape, also appointing to the federal bench in Texas US district court judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, whose recent ruling revoked the Food and Drug Administration’s 23-year-old approval of the abortion drug, mifepristone. The decision has been temporarily stayed. Trump’s comments about abortion being a political liability for Republicans have angered former allies. When Trump blamed the party’s midterm losses on “the abortion issue”, prominent anti-abortion groups fired back with a pointed warning that the former president still needed to earn their support. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America group, told reporters prior to the March For Life in January that any candidate who did not support national restrictions on abortion had “disqualified him or herself as a presidential candidate in our eyes”. Jon Schweppe, policy director of the conservative American Principles Project, said Trump was not wrong that abortion had hurt Republicans in recent elections. But he said the answer was not to abandon the push for a nationwide ban, rather it was to build consensus within the party around a federal standard, such as a prohibiting the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy. “I think [Trump] sees abortion as why we lost the midterms and he’s not totally wrong,” Schweppe said. “But the answer is not: ‘There’s no federal role. We’er not going to do anything any more – I delivered you Dobbs.’ It’s gotta be: ‘This is the next step.’” “The pro-life movement still has quite a bit of sway,” he added, “and it’s going to have a major sway in the presidential primary.”',\n",
       " 'Lawyers pledge to challenge ruling in higher court, saying they believe judiciary will ‘uphold justice’ The Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has been dealt a blow after a court rejected his plea for a stay on his recent defamation conviction, meaning he could face jail and will lose his parliamentary seat as he appeals against the guilty verdict. On Thursday, lawyers for Gandhi said a court in India’s western state of Gujarat had rejected his petition seeking a stay of conviction. The rejection of the plea means Gandhi is disqualified from office and there will now be a byelection in his Kerala constituency. Gandhi’s lawyers said they would challenge the ruling in a higher court. “We are going to challenge the decision in Gujarat high court tomorrow. We have full faith that the judiciary will uphold justice and save the democracy,” said Naishadh Desai. In March, Gandhi was convicted of defamation by a court in Gujarat over a 2019 speech made on the campaign trail in which he linked the prime minister, Narendra Modi, with two high-profile criminals, commenting: “Why is it that all thieves have Modi as a common name?” Purnesh Modi, a legislator in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, subsequently filed a case in the courts alleging that all those named Modi in the country had been offended and defamed by Gandhi’s comment. The case had stagnated in the courts for almost two years, but earlier this year it was resumed and Gandhi was convicted of defamation in March. He was given the maximum possible sentence, a two-year jail term, which the judge said was due to Gandhi’s “status as a parliamentarian” which made his comments more public and therefore more serious. It was also the minimum jail sentence needed in order to expel Gandhi from parliament, which happened less than 24 hours after his conviction. If his sentence is upheld, it could see him banned from holding political office for six years. Gandhi was granted 30 days bail after the ruling. He immediately filed an appeal, calling the sentence “harsh and excessive”, arguing that the case was “politically motivated” and that a “cloak of defamation” had been used as a means to get him expelled from parliament. Gandhi’s lawyers have also argued that the 130 million people called Modi in India are not one collective group that can be defamed and that the sentence was based on “conjecture not evidence”. The refusal by the courts to give Gandhi relief in the case could signal that he faces an uphill battle to get the verdict overturned through an appeal. Many in the Congress party expect the fight to go all the way up to the supreme court. Opposition figures and critics have said the defamation case against Gandhi is being used as part of an attack on opposition parties by the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) and symptomatic of an increasingly politicised judiciary. Many pointed out that the defamation case against Gandhi only began to gather pace this year, just as he was drawing public attention to Prime Minister Modi’s links to the Indian billionaire industrialist Gautam Adani, whose company was recently accused of committing the “largest corporate con in history”. The company has issued a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations. While out on bail, Gandhi has continued to be politically vocal and this week has been out on the campaign trail in Karnataka, where Congress is fighting to topple the BJP in the state elections next month. “The BJP think I can be intimidated with disqualification but I am not scared,” Gandhi told a rally this week.',\n",
       " \"Increase to 4.5% will be last rise in current cycle, says former rate-setter Michael Saunders The Bank of England is likely to increase interest rates one more time in May, to 4.5%, before inflation falls “sharply” over the rest of the year, a former rate-setter has predicted. Michael Saunders, who was a member of the monetary policy committee until August, said the UK was nearly at a “turning point” for interest rates, which have risen sharply over the past year as policymakers tried to curb a surge in prices caused by a spike in energy costs. He said his former colleagues at the Bank of England would most probably vote for a final increase in May – which would be the 12th in a row – before holding interest rates steady over the following months. “I think they’ll raise interest rates again at the May meeting another 25 basis points … That’ll take interest rates up to 4.5%, ” Saunders said. “I think we get this further, probably final, hike in May, and then probably a long period in which interest rates are fairly stable. The big tightening cycle – interest rates going up meeting after meeting – I think that’s largely over and what you’ll see over the rest of this year is inflation crawling lower, interest rates stable.” Households are likely to breathe a sigh of relief if Saunders’ predictions prove correct, given most have seen bills for groceries, heating and other essential goods soar in recent months. The increases after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine have piled pressure on the poorest households in Britain, who spend a larger share of their income on essentials. Saunders said: “The overwhelming factor behind the rise in inflation has been the surge in energy prices – that’s lifted households gas and electricity bills, pushed up firms cost. So [they’ve] seen a ripple through to higher services inflation, higher goods, price inflation and it’s also contributed to the rise in food prices.” That, for example, has then resulted in higher prices in stores and restaurant menus, as businesses try to recoup their own surging costs. “Those indirect, second-round effects, of higher energy costs take a while to come through. They’re not yet finished, but we are probably now past the peak,” he said. “We are now just about finally at the turning point. With interest rates having gone up pretty sharply … and agricultural commodities coming lower, wholesale energy prices coming off, we’re now likely to see inflation fall pretty sharply over the rest of this year.” His comments come days after the Office for National Statistics figures showed inflation fell by less than expected, to 10.1% last month. Economists had forecast a decline to 9.8%. Sign up to Business Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The likelihood of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month increased following the news about inflation, with markets subsequently pricing in a 97% chance of a rise to 4.5% on 11 May – matching Saunders’ predictions. Economists at UBS are also predicting a further interest rate rise in May, and are expecting inflation to average 6.5% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024, before dropping to the Bank of England’s 2% target by the end of 2025.\",\n",
       " 'Michael Schumacher’s family are planning legal action against a German weekly magazine over an “interview” with the seven times Formula One champion that was generated by artificial intelligence. A spokesperson for the Schumacher family, asked by Reuters for a comment on Wednesday, pointed to published reports of legal action. The Ferrari great has not been seen in public since he suffered a serious brain injury in a skiing accident on a family holiday in the French Alps in December 2013. The latest edition of Die Aktuelle ran a front cover with a picture of a smiling Schumacher and the headline promising “Michael Schumacher, the first interview”. The strapline added: “It sounded deceptively real.” The supposed quotes by Schumacher read: “My life has completely changed since [the accident]. That was a horrible time for my wife, my children and the whole family. “I was so badly injured that I lay for months in a kind of artificial coma, because otherwise my body couldn’t have dealt with it all.” In the end, it emerged that the supposed quotes had been produced by AI. Since Schumacher’s accident, his family has guarded his privacy, with access limited to those closest to him and little information given about his condition. “We live together at home. We do therapy. We do everything we can to make Michael better and to make sure he’s comfortable, and to simply make him feel our family, our bond,” Corinna Schumacher said in a 2021 Netflix documentary. “We’re trying to carry on as a family, the way Michael liked it and still does. And we are getting on with our lives. “‘Private is private’, as he always said. It’s very important to me that he can continue to enjoy his private life as much as possible. Michael always protected us, and now we are protecting Michael.” Schumacher’s son Mick is currently the Mercedes reserve driver in Formula One, after losing his seat at Haas at the end of last season.',\n",
       " 'Vladimir Putin hails achievement that beat Hollywood project announced by Tom Cruise, Nasa and Elon Musk’s SpaceX The first feature film shot in space premiered in Russian cinemas on Thursday, as Moscow exulted in beating a rival Hollywood project amid a confrontation with the west. The Challenge is about a surgeon dispatched to the International Space Station (ISS) to save an injured cosmonaut. Russia sent an actor and a film director for a 12-day stint on the ISS in October 2021 to film scenes aboard the orbiting laboratory. The Russian crew beat a Hollywood project announced in 2020 by Tom Cruise together with Nasa and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has lauded the film, saying: “We are the first to have shot a feature film in orbit, aboard a spacecraft. Once again the first.” The Soviet Union pioneered space travel and the film crew’s mission added to a long list of firsts for Russia’s space industry after several setbacks, including botched launches. In The Challenge a surgeon played by Yulia Peresild, 38, is sent to the ISS to save a cosmonaut injured during a spacewalk. The director, Klim Shipenko, 39, who was in charge of camera, lighting and sound, brought back 30 hours of footage, 50 minutes of which were used in the final cut. Peresild and Shipenko underwent training for four months before going to space on a Soyuz spacecraft accompanied by a cosmonaut. The sequences were shot in the Russian module of the ISS and featured cameo appearances by three Russian cosmonauts stationed there at the time. The camera followed Peresild moving through the cramped space, her blonde hair floating in zero gravity. Before the film’s release, the capsule which brought Peresild and Shipenko back to Earth was put on display in central Moscow.

       " 'Ukraine had said a satellite reentering the atmosphere was the cause of the phenomenon, but the space agency has denied this A flash in the sky over the Ukrainian capital prompted confusion and alarm as city authorities said it was caused by a Nasa satellite reentering the atmosphere, while the US space agency denied involvement. A “bright glow” was observed over Kyiv around 10pm local time, the head of Kyiv’s military administration Sergiy Popko wrote on Telegram. An air raid alert was activated, Popko said, but “air defence was not in operation”. Shortly after, the Ukrainian air force said the flash was “related to the fall of a satellite/meteorite”. But a Nasa spokesperson denied this assessment, telling the AFP news agency that the satellite in question was “still in orbit”. The US space agency had announced earlier this week that a retired 300kg satellite would reenter the atmosphere some time on Wednesday. “However, that reentry has not yet occurred … No other Nasa satellite reentered the atmosphere earlier today,” a Nasa spokesperson told AFP. The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) spacecraft, used to observe solar flares, was launched into low Earth orbit in 2002 and decommissioned in 2018, Nasa said. Speculation and memes abounded on Ukrainian social media after several channels posted videos showing the powerful flash lighting up the sky over Kyiv. “While social media is amused by flying saucer memes … please do not use the official symbol of the air force to create memes!” an air force tweet said. In a statement on Monday, Nasa had said it expected most of the RHESSI spacecraft to burn up as it reentered the atmosphere. “But some components are expected to survive reentry,” Nasa said, adding that the risk of harm to anyone on Earth was low – approximately one in 2,467.',\n",
       " 'Documenting the drivers, railway workers and passengers on Europe’s third largest rail network during an extraordinary year in which Ukraine defied Russia’s plan to conquer the country Two institutions have played a crucial role in thwarting Russia’s plan to conquer Ukraine. One is the Ukrainian army. It successfully defended the capital, Kyiv, and has recaptured large swathes of territory seized last year by Moscow in the north-east and south. Another counteroffensive looms. The second – surprisingly, perhaps – is Ukraine’s railway. This network with 15,000 miles (24,000km) of track is Europe’s third largest. It has become a lifeline for the war-torn country. Since Vladimir Putin’s invasion the railway has helped bring civilians to safety. It has transported 4 million people and an estimated 120,000 pets. Eight million have fled abroad and 6.2 million are internally displaced, in the continent’s biggest refugee crisis since 1945. The railways have made another contribution to the war effort, enabling soldiers to return from battle and to spend time with loved ones. The morale of Ukrainian soldiers is high, in contrast to their demoralised Russian adversaries. Special trains evacuate the wounded. Some are service personnel; others are residents caught up in shelling. Travelling doctors treat the injured. The main hall of the train station in Bakhmut, damaged by Russian shelling The Dutch photographer and multimedia journalist Jelle Krings has documented the activities of drivers, railway workers and passengers, during an extraordinary year in which Ukraine has defied Russia. His exhibition Iron People includes photographs, video and a short documentary film. The images are moving, vivid and sometimes poignant: a portrait of a nation on the move, fighting for its survival. Krings, 32, was in Poland last spring when Russia’s all-out attack began. He took photos of refugees as they poured across the border, tens of thousands arriving each day, most of them women and children. In early March he went to Ukraine and documented refugees as they arrived into Lviv’s central station, on refugee trains from the east. He interviewed drivers before they returned to the frontline. “I was inspired by their sheer courage and sense of duty. They were ordinary people who risked their lives to save others. Overnight they essentially became war zone rescue workers,” he said. In May and June he travelled to Kharkiv and the Donbas region and last autumn visited liberated areas in Kharkiv oblast and the southern city of Kherson. Krings spoke with employees who restored railway tracks in heavily mined locations, newly freed from Russian troops. He visited repair factories targeted by enemy missiles. This year he spent time with rail workers in their homes, listening to their stories of life under bombardment and enemy occupation, and shooting their portraits.

Right; as an air raid alarm goes off, factory workers move underground to a Soviet-era bunker “The railway system shows the resilience and confidence of Ukraine as a people. You find this across Ukrainian society,” Krings said. He described the process of editing his pictures as an “emotional ride”. “There are refugees peering out of the windows. They have these looks, filled with grief and loss. Railway workers help them at great personal risk and sacrifice. You see and feel everyone’s pain,” he said. Krings photographed the body of a woman who collapsed and died, after getting on a packed evacuation train. She lay under a blue blanket at Lviv station. In Pokrovsk in Donbas he watched as train attendants hefted a bedridden 71-year-old woman onboard. Days earlier a bomb hit a carriage carrying humanitarian aid. “There was a loud bang and smoke rose above the tracks,” he said. Ludmilla Chutko, 71 – who had difficulties walking since a fall before the war – is carried on an evacuation train by workers from Ukrainian Railways, police and her son Vladimir Chutko, 47. She says they had to leave because the situation deteriorated and the shelling became too much to bear.

Ukrainian trains are known for their punctuality, with more than 90% arriving on time. The war has not affected performance, in part because engines never go especially fast, rolling at 55mph. Carriages are clean and comfortable: the best way of getting around a vast country. Stewards look after night train customers and bring them morning tea in filigree holders. Refugees from Ukraine rest in the gym of a primary school in Poland, turned into a temporary shelter. Most refugees stay in the school for a few days to a week, before continuing their journey for shelter elsewhere in the EU With airports closed, the railway has a political function as well, delivering important international guests. They include the US president, Joe Biden, who in February dropped in to see Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv, days before the invasion anniversary. It was a 20-hour trip both ways. Numerous prime ministers and VIPs have used the train including Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer and Bono from U2. Krings grew up in a village outside Amsterdam. As a teenager, he would take the train into the city, returning late at night. The journey, he recalled, took 10 minutes. In Ukraine the distances are bigger, with the trip from Pokrovsk to Lviv lasting 36 hours. Services have reopened in territory seized back from Russia, including from Kyiv to Kherson, occupied by Moscow for eight brutal months. An evacuation train ran by Médecins Sans Frontières carrying refugees from Donbas at the train station of Dnipro The railway employs 230,000 people. Three hundred have died since the war started, 19 of them while on duty. Working for the state-owned company is seen as a respected profession with stable hours. There are train “families” where several generations do the same job. Previously Krings covered the climate crisis in Africa and the refugee crisis. He is interested, he says, in covering subjects in depth and “humanising” complex geopolitical issues. Angelina and Kosta say their goodbyes through the window of an evacuation train heading to Poland. Angelina is pregnant with their child. Under martial law imposed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, men between the ages of 18 and 60 are not allowed to leave the country Krings plans to exhibit his photos in train stations and museums, and as a multimedia project in Amsterdam. Some material is harrowing. One interviewee, Tetiana Vislohuzova, recalled how she evacuated an 11-year-old girl who lost both her legs in a missile strike. The train manager spoke with another six-year-old boy who told her he watched as his friend was “torn apart” by a strike. Ukrainian serviceman Dima and his newly wedded wife Veronica on their wedding day during Dima’s break from the frontline - June 2022. Overall, railway workers are a remarkable and brave group. “They have seen more grief than even people on the frontline. There is so much trauma. But they keep showing up no matter the risk,” Krings said. Luke Harding’s Invasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival is published by Guardian Faber',\n",
       " \"Moscow using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels to monitor potential sabotage targets, say broadcasters A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of several Nordic countries alleges that Russia has established a state-run programme using spy ships disguised as fishing vessels aimed at giving it the capability to attack windfarms and communications cables in the North Sea. The investigation quotes a Danish counter-intelligence officer who claims the sabotage strategy is designed to be implemented in the event that Russia and the west enter a full-blown conflict. A Norwegian intelligence officer told the broadcasters the scheme had been given huge importance – and by extension, resources – by the Kremlin and was being controlled directly from Moscow. The first in a series of reports by the broadcasters DR in Denmark, NRK in Norway, SVT in Sweden and Yle in Finland is due to be aired on Wednesday evening. The broadcasters say Russia has disguised some espionage boats as fishing trawlers and scientific research vessels in the North Sea. According to intelligence sources quoted by the broadcasters, the boats have underwater surveillance apparatus onboard that can be used to map crucial sites of interest viewed by Moscow as potential sabotage targets.

In a separate development, the Danish government released official documents on Tuesday detailing for the first time how Danish defence patrols had taken 112 photographs of Russian vessels off its coast days before the Nord Stream pipeline explosion in the Baltic Sea in September. The explosion destroyed the pipeline and led to the discharge of large amounts of gas. The German news portal T-Online had reported on the Danish patrol operation in September, several days before the explosion. The portal’s report said the Russian ships were equipped with loading cranes and a mini-submarine and were operating just outside Danish and Swedish radar zones. A joint investigation into the explosion by authorities in Denmark, Sweden and Germany is under way. While there is consensus that the explosions were the result of a sabotage attack, responsibility has not been definitively ascertained, though the “clear main scenario” based on the nature of explosive used is that a state-sponsored group was involved, according to a Swedish prosecutor involved in the investigation. German investigators are reportedly following up a lead relating to the movements of a sailing yacht, Andromeda, and its moderate-sized crew, which it is believed might have been behind the attack. The Nordic broadcasters’ investigation identified what it referred to as ghost ships – vessels that have turned off their transmitters so as to keep their locations secret. Intercepted communications between the ships have been monitored by authorities and the broadcasters have also had access to recordings of them. Particular focus has been given to the Admiral Vladimirsky, which is registered as an expeditionary oceanographic ship, but is believed to be a Russian spy ship. Sign up to This is Europe The most pivotal stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion An unidentified former Royal Navy expert followed the route the Vladimirsky took close to seven windfarms off the UK and Dutch coast on one of its journeys. He described how the ship, which did not turn its transmitter on for a whole month, noticeably reduced its speed when it approached windfarm sites and appeared to linger in those areas. A reporter who approached the ship was confronted by a man clad in a balaclava and bulletproof vest and appearing to wield a military assault rifle. The UK Defence Journal reported in November that the same ship had been seen off the Scottish coast that month, entering the Moray Firth and sighted close to Lossiemouth, home to the Royal Air Force’s maritime patrol aircraft fleet. Two months ago, Dutch intelligence warned of possible attempts to disrupt or destroy marine infrastructure, after a Russian ship was sighted close to a windfarm in the North Sea, where it was believed to be carrying out undersea mapping. The severing of an underwater data cable off the Norwegian coast last year, which authorities said could have been caused by human activity, is also believed to be possibly connected to the Russian programme. Earlier this month, Norway expelled 15 Russian officials it accused of spying.\",\n",
       " 'Thirteen years after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, documents shed light on the company’s response and ‘scorched earth’ legal tactics  After 18 rounds of chemotherapy, Samuel Castleberry is tired. If it were up to him, he’d still be working his trucking job. The 59-year-old was making a decent living and felt fit. But in June 2020, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has already spread to his liver. Now he gets out of breath wheeling his garbage can to the curb at his home in Mobile, Alabama. Floyd Ruffin, 58, grew up around horses in Gibson, an unincorporated community in south Louisiana. In 2015, he was also diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has made it uncomfortable for him to ride. Before his prostate was removed, he had dreams of having more kids. Terry Odom, 53, lies awake at night in her home in San Antonio, Texas. She worries that she, too, has cancer. As a chemist she’s used to finding answers, but she can’t figure out why her health is deteriorating. She’s emailed dozens of doctors and researchers in search of answers. “You feel like you might die before your time,” she said. A single disaster unites the three of them. Thirteen years ago, they helped clean up BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest ever in US waters. They rushed toward the toxic oil to save the place they loved, joining forces with more than 33,000 others to clean up our coastlines. Now, they have active lawsuits against BP, saying the company made them sick. Since the cleanup, thousands have experienced chronic respiratory issues, rashes and diarrhea – a problem known among local residents as “BP syndrome” or “Gulf coast syndrome”. Others, like Castleberry and Ruffin, have developed cancer. The valor displayed by cleanup workers was comparable to the heroism of first responders during the 9/11 terror attacks, who ran to the World Trade Center to save people and breathed in toxic dust and fumes, said the Alaska toxicologist Riki Ott, who became involved in advocating for oil spill cleanup workers after the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska. “What resident and professional oil spill responders do is exactly what professional firefighters and emergency responders everywhere do: put their lives on the line to protect ours,” she said. But while those who responded to the deadliest single terror attack in American history have been rightly cemented into public memory, coastal workers in some of the poorest parts of the country – those who laid their bodies on the line following the worst industrial catastrophe in a generation – have faded away, unrecognized and left to fight for themselves. On 20 April 2010, a rig contracted by the oil and gas company BP to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico blew up, spewing more than 200m gallons of oil. Eleven workers were killed that day, but some argue the spill’s death toll could be far higher – and underreported – as cleanup workers soon started to develop illnesses they claim are linked to exposure to toxins in the oil as well as Corexit, the chemical that was used by BP to break up oil slicks. During the 87 days that oil gushed from the seafloor, lower-income workers in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida picked up tar balls from beaches, sopped up oil with absorbent booms, decontaminated boats, and burned oil on the water surface. They also rescued wildlife, including oiled birds, sea turtles and dolphins. Some were Vietnamese fishers put out of work when Gulf waters were closed to shrimping. Others were Cajun construction workers and Black cowboys. Most had livelihoods that depended on the Gulf. Those contractors worked the spill for weeks or months at a time, and about 30% of them had annual household incomes under $20,000, according to demographic data collected by the National Institutes of Health. BP told many of its cleanup workers that they did not need to wear breathing protection because the toxic components of the oil had evaporated or were broken down in the waves, according to the company’s safety briefings. Despite receiving advice from the federal government to conduct biological monitoring by measuring toxins in the cleanup workers’ blood, skin or urine, BP didn’t collect evidence that could have shown whether toxins contained in the oil had entered workers’ bloodstreams, according to plaintiffs’ attorneys. In 2010, BP ran a huge PR campaign to convince the public that the Gulf would recover. While the smell of oil and Corexit was still in the air, BP was already building its legal defense against the very workers it claimed were repairing the spill’s environmental damage, according to new evidence reported for the first time by the Guardian. There is no class-action settlement for the cleanup workers and coastal residents who fell ill years after the spill. Due to the terms of an earlier settlement, they must sue BP individually to be compensated for their chronic injuries, and many of the cases are under a court order that prevents them from seeking punitive damages. BP declined to comment on a series of detailed questions from the Guardian, citing the ongoing litigation. A district court judge found that the company that made the Corexit used during the BP spill, Nalco Holding Co, was not liable for medical claims related to the use of its product during the spill because the use was approved by the federal government, according to court documents. Ecolab Inc purchased the company in 2011 but later sold it to a subsidiary, Corexit Environmental Solutions LLC. (When contacted by the Guardian, Corexit Environmental Solutions said it was never involved in any decisions related to the use of its product in the Gulf.) BP paid $65m to 22,588 people in the earlier medical settlement for short-term illnesses, less than $3,000 each on average, according to a 2019 claims administrator update. The company also spent more than $60bn to resolve economic and natural resources claims from the spill as well as civil penalties under the Clean Water Act. But in the cases of long-term health problems, the odds have not been in plaintiffs’ favor. The oil and gas multinational has taken a “scorched-earth” approach to each lawsuit, said the attorney Jerry Sprague, who has filed about 600 medical cases against BP. According to eastern district of Louisiana court records, nearly 5,000 cases had been filed as of January 2020. The company has hired experts in hundreds of cases and in certain instances deposed plaintiffs and their doctors for hours, combing over their medical records, tax returns and employment files. “BP wants us to know they will fight these cases to the end,” Sprague said. In court, BP has argued that without biological evidence, workers and coastal residents cannot prove their illnesses were caused by the oil spill, despite research linking exposure to the spill with increased risk of cancer and higher rates of long term respiratory conditions, heart disease, headaches, memory loss and blurred vision. Thousands of cases have been dismissed, according to plaintiff lawyers. Only one known case has resulted in settlement. “It’s by far the most gut-wrenching public health disaster that I’ve ever been exposed to,” said Tom Devine, the legal director for the Government Accountability Project, which has produced several reports based on interviews with sick cleanup workers. “What’s particularly frustrating is BP doesn’t care,” he said. The Guardian interviewed more than two dozen former cleanup workers in the reporting of this story. Many had never spoken publicly before. Frank Stuart Sr, a father of six, described the cleanup work as a “crusade”. He led a team of boats to stop oil from washing into an estuary in south Louisiana, between Lafitte and Grand Isle. They worked 15-hour days for months. “This was a crusade to make sure that we protected the wetlands. We made sure that if there was a fisherman or crew member who needed work, we put them to work so they wouldn’t lose their home. They wouldn’t lose their car. They had a way to eat,” he said in a video recorded by his daughter, Bailey Stuart, in 2017. The following year, Frank Stuart was diagnosed with myeloid leukemia, a rare cancer. His condition quickly deteriorated. His wife of 22 years, Sheree Kerner, sat next to his hospital bed on her laptop, trying to understand what had made her husband sick. Her search led her back to Stuart’s exposure to the toxic combination of BP oil and Corexit. On 19 April 2018, the day before the eighth anniversary of the BP oil spill, her husband died at home in her arms. “It’s just egregious they could get away with murder,” Kerner said of BP. She has filed a suit against the oil company for her husband’s death. To get a fuller picture of the illnesses cleanup workers and coastal residents say were caused by the spill, the Guardian analyzed a random sample of 400 lawsuits filed against BP. Sinus issues are the most common chronic health problem listed among those who have sued, followed by eye, skin, and respiratory ailments. Chronic rhinosinusitis, a swelling of the sinuses in the nose and head that causes nasal drip and pain in the face, was the most common condition. Most of the plaintiffs were cleanup workers. One was a first responder and one lived near where oil washed ashore in Gulfport, Mississippi. About 2% of the plaintiffs have cancer, but public health advocates believe more are likely to be diagnosed in the years to come. “Your results are pretty much what a Yale University study found 13 years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill,” Ott said. “I believe that more oil spill-related cancers will develop over the years.” John Pabst, 64, also links his cancer diagnosis to his cleanup work during the spill. It was filthy work. The stench of burning oil wafted through the air, and the humidity and searing temperatures left those out on the water exhausted, sweaty and dehydrated. Pabst remembers hauling soft boom lines 200ft long from the marshes in his small shrimping boat, the thick, greasy, diesel-like smell of Corexit and oil lingering around his vessel. But Pabst, a barrel chested and broad shouldered man whose family has caught shrimp off the Gulf coast for three generations, took pride in the work. The pay was generous. The cleanup efforts were imperative to preserve his way of living for future generations. “It was a dirty, nasty, stinky job,” he recalled one recent morning sipping coffee near his home in Chalmette, in south-eastern Louisiana. He would go through three packets of baby wipes a week out on the water, washing sweat from his face, leaving his eyes stinging and his head throbbing throughout the 11-hour shifts. The headaches and nausea became chronic in the aftermath and then, in 2017, he was diagnosed with lymphoma in his eye, which he claims was caused by months of exposure to toxins during the cleanup. Rounds of radiation therapy followed. The process, he said, left him with claustrophobia and PTSD, and lingering worries about if and when the cancer would return. “You always wonder: was it worth the money I made?” he said, his case still pending in federal court. “We made 10 grand every other week for three or four months [during the clean-up]. But sometimes we’d make more than that shrimping. “But now, every time something happens with my health, you wonder: is this part of the cancer?” Last fall, Sprague, the attorney, filed a motion alleging that BP had a duty to collect and preserve data on cleanup worker exposure levels, but it didn’t do so to help its defense against future litigation. Oil was still gushing into the Gulf of Mexico when three federal entities, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and National Research Council all submitted plans suggesting that BP biomonitor cleanup workers, according to emails uncovered during discovery. Biomonitoring is a way to measure chemical exposure levels by testing bodily fluids for toxins repeatedly over time. This type of monitoring is helpful in determining causation of acute and chronic illnesses. But instead of monitoring workers’ bodies, BP spent more than $13m monitoring air. In an email to his colleagues, John Howard, the director of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, wrote that air monitoring alone doesn’t capture all of the ways that toxins could enter workers’ bodies. In an email dated 27 June 2010, found during discovery, he wrote: .css-cumn2r{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Since air sampling does not reflect total exposure, and total exposure may be more associated with longer term health effects, the continuation of our approach without incorporating biomonitoring (1) represents only a partial approach to determine exposure; (2) leaves us scientifically incomplete; (3) leaves us unable to address the concerns of those who are in the media now saying that harmful exposures are occurring despite negative air sampling results. He went on to say that the lack of biomonitoring would also impair researchers’ ability to conduct long-term health studies. Howard did not respond to requests for comment. To conduct the air monitoring, BP hired a company called CTEH. In June 2010, two members of Congress wrote a letter to BP highlighting the company’s decision to contract with the consulting firm, which has a track record of working with companies to downplay the risks of major pollution events for which they’re responsible. Murphy Oil hired CTEH in 2005 to perform testing after the company’s refinery was flooded by Hurricane Katrina and leaked 1m gallons of oil into 1,800 homes in Meraux and Chalmette, Louisiana. The US congresswoman Lois Capps and senator Peter Welch wrote that hiring CTEH was “yet another misstep at the expense of the public’s health”. CTEH was recently hired by Norfolk Southern, the operator of the train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio. Though CTEH said its testing showed no harmful chemicals in the homes of nearby residents, ProPublica and the Guardian talked to several experts who said the tests were inadequate and couldn’t prove that residents were safe. During discovery, Sprague’s firm found a chain of emails among BP’s internal medical team from 31 July 2010 in which they discuss the company’s air monitoring efforts. “Although we are documenting zero exposures in most monitoring efforts, the monitoring itself adds value in the eyes of public perception, and zeros add value in defending potential litigation,” wrote John Fink, a BP industrial hygienist. For Sprague, this was a critical revelation. “You have an admission right there that BP is going to do air monitoring not because they’re trying to find dangers in the air but to defend against future litigation,” Sprague said about the email. “The scientists are saying we should do biomonitoring. BP ignores it. How does that look when you know they’re still going to do air monitoring to defend litigation?” BP declined to answer questions on its toxic exposure monitoring during the disaster. Jorey Danos keeps reminders of the disaster scattered around his one-acre homestead in the small Cajun town of Golden Meadow, Louisiana. There are jars of brown seawater that contain oil from the spill still floating at the top; suitcases full of his legal documents that bulge with paper and his ID cards from four months working on the cleanup, his photo now faded and scratched. Danos was 31 when he stepped forward to to address the spill. Now in his early 40s, he’s already taken retirement, suffering from a variety of long-term conditions he attributes to the Deepwater disaster, including chronic abdominal and stomach pain and loss of memory. His recollections of work out on the Gulf remain vivid, however: pelicans smothered in oil, dolphins spewing oily water from their blowholes. “It was just a total disaster,” he said. “Apocalyptic.” His suit for medical damages was dismissed last year, records show. “It’s not about the money any more,” Danos said as he sat in his backyard looking through the paper remnants of his case. “I wanted a guilty verdict, and I wanted them to explain why they had to use toxic chemicals known to be harmful to humans.” Documents suggest that not much was done by BP to prepare cleanup workers for the toxic risks associated with the job. Recently released BP training modules, obtained in discovery by the Downs Law Group, a Miami-based law firm involved in more than 100 active spill cases, have led the firm to argue that clean-up workers received minimal briefing on toxic hazards. Instead, the warnings appear to have focused on heat exhaustion, insects and the risks of trips and falls. In one module, prepared for shoreline workers, the risk of exposure to dispersant is characterized as “very unlikely”, adding that the “health effects would be similar to exposure to any mild detergent”. “Dispersants used in the Gulf have no ingredients that cause long-term health effects, including cancer,” the slide reads. The module also assures shoreline workers they should not need to wear protective breathing gear because they would be exposed only to less hazardous weathered oil, rather than more toxic crude oil. But BP’s own internal safety documents say that even weathered oil still poses a hazard if it contacts the skin, potentially causing skin, eye irritation, and diarrhea. And wearing safety goggles, Tyvek protective suits, rubber boots and gloves when in contact with the substance “might not be adequate”, the document states. Another training module assures cleanup workers that by the time oil reaches the shore, it will have been “subject to time and distance ‘weathering’ before impacting shoreline”. BP declined to answer questions about its training of cleanup workers. James “Catfish” Miller said he had received almost no protective clothing at all when he began his work for BP about a month after the catastrophe began. “I said it about 9,000 times: ‘Where’s our boots and gloves, our Tyvek suits?’ They didn’t have none to give us,” he recalled, remembering his early days working off the coast of Biloxi, Mississippi. “Zero. Zilch-o. But we didn’t complain. The pay was good.” The slicks would run for miles, coating his shrimp boat in thick smears of a tar-like substance. He claimed to have received so little training that one day early on, when rope was caught in the propeller of his boat, he jumped into the polluted water to cut the rope with no skin protection, treating the incident as he would on any normal day shrimping out in the gulf. His symptoms began soon after - nausea, headaches, diarrhea. He nicknamed his deckhand “the canary” because he was the first to pass out. But soon after, Miller did too. About a month and half into the work, he was hospitalized after his esophagus began to bleed during chronic vomiting. He was bed-bound for months and lost over half his body weight, he recalled. “I thought I was going to die. It was chemical poisoning.” he recalled. “I just couldn’t bounce back.” The recovery took years and he has battled spates of anxiety and depression ever since. The experience led to the breakdown of his marriage. Miller’s lawsuit for long-term medical damages was dismissed in September last year, according to records. “I think we’ve just been robbed of our health in our life,” he said. Within a month of the spill, BP began running an aggressive and expansive local PR campaign, placing frequent advertisements in local newspapers around the Gulf coast over the next year. The company’s army of local cleanup workers were placed front and center. “We have organized the largest environmental response in this country’s history,” proclaimed one advertisement in the Advocate newspaper on 3 June 2010. “More than 3m feet of boom, 30 planes and over 1,300 boats are working to protect the shoreline. When oil reaches the shore, thousands of people are ready to clean it up.” The campaign ran under the banner: “We will make this right.” Over a decade later, the phrase would be repeated almost verbatim as the slogan to another campaign promoting the corporate response to the toxic disaster in East Palestine, Ohio. The Louisiana chemist Wilma Subra understood the potential for the BP spill to result in a public health disaster. She advocated for cleanup workers to be given respirators and other personal protective equipment during the spill response, with little success. Soon, she noticed something else: “BP signed agreements with every technical expert they could get their hands on,” she said. “You could clearly see it was aimed toward making them look good and not presenting the real negative impacts of it.” In addition to trying to control the public narrative, BP put researchers on its payroll and had a role in reviewing certain scientific research about the impacts of the spill. The Downs Law Group uncovered an internal BP spreadsheet in discovery that appears to track the company’s review process in the publication of 29 scientific studies on a variety of topics, including the spill’s toxicity and impacts on birds, fish and oysters. The spreadsheet, last updated by BP in 2013 or early 2014, shows the company had several steps in its approval process, including “tech review” “sent to author for changes”, and “final legal/BP review”. Annotated next to a study about the impacts of oil and dispersant on oysters, the company notes: “Back with author for changes.” Not all of the studies listed in BP’s research tracker were published with disclosures indicating that BP provided comments, suggested revisions and performed a legal review of the contents. “BP influenced the science,” said David Durkee, an attorney with the Downs Law Group. “I think it’s becoming more apparent, at least through these documents, that BP had an active influence in trying to put a finger on the scale.” But other studies published in the past five years have linked exposure to the 2010 BP spill with a slew of health problems, including heart conditions, neurological symptoms and an increased rate of births of premature and underweight infants. These health studies build upon those from the other spills, such as the Prestige oil tanker spill off the coast of Spain in 2002 and the Hebei Spirit oil tanker spill in South Korean waters in 2007. Health effect research on the Hebei Spirit Oil Spill was given the acronym Heros to denote the cleanup workers’ efforts to fight back the oil as it washed ashore, Ott said. “They’re acknowledging that the participants in their studies are heroes,” she said of the South Korean cohort study name. The province in South Korea where the spill washed ashore built a memorial hall to commemorate the cleanup effort. For two years, 11 life-sized steel figures stood in the neutral ground of a busy New Orleans street to memorialize the men who died when BP’s rig exploded in 2010. Those sculptures are no longer there, and the BP oil spill cleanup workers were never memorialized. “Individuals are being victimized twice, the way I see it,” Ott said. One person has won a settlement so far: Captain John Maas. Maas had just received his boat captain’s license when the oil began washing ashore in Mississippi. He and his girlfriend at the time went out in search of oiled birds and turtles to rescue. Four months later, she died from cancer. “That sort of lit a fire under my ass,” Maas said. He filed a suit against BP for his own health issues resulting from the spill, chemically induced asthma and restrictive lung disease. Maas was deposed by BP twice, totaling 15 hours of questioning, he recalled. BP also deposed his doctor, Dr Charles Wray, prodding him to say that Maas’s asthma was actually caused by his obesity, not the oil spill. But, according to transcripts, Wray was unswayed and the company ultimately settled the suit. Both Maas and his attorney, William “Ken” Burger, were required to sign confidentiality agreements limiting them from speaking publicly about the terms of the settlement. “I have no illusion that this is over. None. … One little dumbass 9th-grade-educated captain beat them. But that’s not the real story,” Maas said. “The real story is how everyone else lost.” Dr Veena Antony, a professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, was also deposed in the Maas case. Breathing in even a small amount of Corexit can cause damage to lung tissues, and make the tissue more permeable to toxins, she said. Like a game of Red Rover, the first breath of dispersant breaks open the cell barrier, allowing more toxins through in the next breath. “I think that the bottom line is that people suffered in the end,” she said. “To me that suffering is unacceptable. We should recognize that in times of emergencies the No 1 goal needs to be protection of human health.” In March this year, the Biden administration gave the green light to a controversial drilling project in Alaska and leased 1.6m acres in the Gulf of Mexico to energy companies. But the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has failed to enact policy changes since the 2010 BP oil spill to protect future cleanup workers. In 2015, the agency issued a proposed rule to incorporate the lessons learned from the BP spill under the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, the US government’s blueprint for responding to oil spills and other toxic chemical releases. But the rule was never finalized. In 2020, the Alert Project, an advocacy group founded by Ott, sued the EPA for its failure to update its regulations on the use of chemical dispersants during oil spills. A US district court ordered the agency to publish its updated policy by 31 May of this year. The American Petroleum Institute tried to intervene in the case, but was denied by the court. Still, environmental groups say the EPA’s proposed rule is not protective enough and doesn’t consider research published in the past several years showing the human health risks of dispersants. “These are all baby steps. They’re not going to prevent future tragedies,” said Devine, with the Government Accountability Project. “The oil industry will basically have a blank check to use Corexit over and over again.” Castleberry, Ruffin, Odom and many others interviewed by the Guardian say they are still waiting for justice - and waiting to be heard. When Castleberry found out he had cancer, he thought it was God’s way of punishing him for his mistakes. “I just figured it was something that I did somewhere down the line,” he said. He has since come to believe that his cancer is not the product of karma, but of his exposure to the spill. He says BP should pay for their wrongdoing. “I’m a very firm believer that if you do wrong, you’re deserving of the consequences or whatever follows,” he said. Ruffin is checked regularly by his doctors to make sure his prostate cancer has not returned. “So now it’s in the back of my mind that this stuff can pop up at any time,” he said. While he can’t forget how the spill has affected his body, he says the public seems to have moved on. “Now that the beaches are pretty much back to normal as far as the eye can see; those that are sick are being forgotten,” he said. Odom was laid off from her job at a chemical manufacturing plant near Pensacola, Florida, before the spill hit. She was having a hard time finding something else to pay the bills, which is why she took a job as a safety officer during the BP spill response. She was in a Polaris 4-wheeler on the beach when her skin broke out in little bumps. “Like I was dunked in a vat of ants,” she said. The next day she bought herself some long-sleeved shirts to wear to work. When other cleanup workers suffered from heat exhaustion, she took them to a mobile medical trailer to be looked over. But, she said, she was never told to watch out for signs of toxic exposure. Her co-workers were skeptical that what they were doing made sense. “We were there to assure the public that everything was good and everything was safe and that everything was under control,” she said. “And that just was not true.”',\n",
       " 'The civilians of Sudan have been trying to throw off military rule for decades, but now find themselves caught in the middle of a deadly power struggle between former allies turned bitter opponents When I landed in Khartoum in late February, the city was tense. On the short journey to my family home in the suburbs of Sudan’s capital, our car was stopped twice at checkpoints that in recent months have been erected after midnight. A car full of women – my mother, my sister and me – was clearly not the threat the officers were looking out for, so we were ushered onwards. Those manning the checkpoints were an inconsistent crew. Some were in plainclothes, others in military fatigues, the rest in police uniform. You never quite knew who you were dealing with, or exactly what they were afraid of. The only common feature they shared was a jittery menace. They were keeping a close eye on movements in a city where tensions had been rising between the two most powerful men in the country. Sudan’s leader, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Sudanese army, and the country’s deputy leader, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the head of a paramilitary organisation called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), had been sharing power since late 2021, when they had jointly carried out a coup that had ejected civilians from a transitional government. But their alliance soon frayed and they began to regard each other with suspicion. By February, inside Sudan, people were growing increasingly afraid that Burhan and Hemedti could come to blows and plunge the country into armed conflict. Still, life went on. Alongside the heavy security presence, there existed a broadly functioning city, kept afloat by families and communities pooling resources as inflation soared and public infrastructure crumbled. Khartoum’s shops and restaurants shone late into the night, casting their colours on to the checkpoints. As we pulled into our street just before dawn, a single bright makeshift light hung over a table on the side of the road. Gathered around, some of the neighbourhood teens were playing cards. Over the next few weeks, tensions rose. Protests against the military and paramilitary junta – a regular occurrence since the 2021 coup – continued. In early March, a protester in Khartoum was filmed being fatally shot in the chest at close quarters by an army officer. More than 100 protesters had been killed since the coup, but this killing seemed even more gratuitous than usual, an indication of the rising tension and nervousness within and between different security forces. Locals found themselves adapting to the growing threat of violence. Warnings came through on WhatsApp and phone calls, telling people to avoid certain roads blocked by angry citizens and patrolling security forces, and we all found alternative routes as people made their way to weddings, funerals, work, friends. Meanwhile, the two generals escalated their war of words, both attempting to portray themselves as the tribune of the people. Hemedti seized upon the shooting caught on video and called for the proper trial of the officer who shot the protester. Hemedti’s brother, the head of the RSF, said that his forces would not permit the killing or detention of protesters “from now on”. Burhan, in a pointed reference to a power-hungry Hemedti, claimed that the army was now ready to withdraw from politics altogether, and break the cycle of “support[ing] dictatorial governments”. Neither meant it. I left Sudan in mid-March, and a little over six weeks after I had passed the boys playing cards, the main road we took home from the airport would be struck by a missile launched from an army plane, and the airport would be in ruins. It happened quickly. Both sides claim they were provoked and had no choice, but the big moves were made by the RSF. On the morning of Saturday 15 April, I started receiving messages from friends and family in Khartoum saying that they were hearing the sounds of gunfire. Within hours, the RSF had taken over the airport. Civilian aircraft were bombed on the asphalt. Two passengers died in their seats. RSF troops were posting videos from other airports and locations across the country, holding their machine guns aloft. Shortly after the attacks began, as citizens cowered in shock, Hemedti gave an interview to Al Jazeera. He was angry, ranting. Burhan, he said, was a criminal who wants to destroy the country. He would be arrested and brought to justice or “die like any dog”. Hemedti only appeared on the national political scene four years ago. In that short time, he has drawn the army, and all of Sudan, into an unprecedented confrontation – in which the country’s army, under Burhan, now finds itself at war with a large paramilitary force that it cannot dominate, under a leader that it cannot control. How did Hemedti, seemingly overnight, come to capture Sudan’s politics? Hemedti first became a nationally known figure after the Sudanese revolution of 2019, which ousted president Omar al-Bashir, a military dictator who ruled for almost 30 years. Until the revolution, Hemedti was a shadowy background militiaman who worked for Bashir, using his private army to stamp out rebellions in the restive west of the country on behalf of the central government. In February and March 2019, as protests against Bashir intensified, Hemedti’s forces were summoned from the peripheries of the country to support the army in Khartoum. But then, in April 2019, Hemedti made an unexpected move, which would be the start of his remarkable political rise. Since early April, protesters had been camped outside Sudan’s military headquarters, demanding the removal of Bashir. Then, on 11 April, Hemedti decided, in a joint move with the military, to push aside the man who had been his patron and sponsor. After Bashir was removed, Hemedti transitioned from his informal role as head of a militia based outside Khartoum, to becoming incorporated into a post-revolution transitional government, working in partnership with Burhan, the commander in chief of the Sudanese army. For two tense years after the revolution, Hemedti shared power with the army and civilian parties under a civilian prime minister, an arrangement that was supposed to pave the way for democratic elections. After the coup of October 2021, in which civilian elements were ejected from government, Hemedti’s role and power expanded once again. All transitional government bodies were dissolved, and Hemedti became the de facto vice-president of the country, with no civilian checks or buffer between him and the army. He thus consolidated huge executive power, with access to the country’s budget, and the mandate to represent Sudan globally, forging alliances and trade deals. Hemedti is an outsider. If he were just a mid-level Sudanese politician, he would stand out; as a national leader, his style and personal background is even more striking. Unlike any other leader or politician the Sudanese have known, he speaks almost entirely in vernacular, and his Arabic is marked by an accent distinctive to the western tribes who live far away from the usual sources of Sudan’s leaders – Khartoum’s military cantonments and elite salons. Hemedti is folksy, easy in his skin, with a glint in his eye and a smiling mischief to his demeanour that belie his reputation for slaughter. Even his nickname, a diminutive of Mohamed, meaning “a little Mohamed”, is a nod to his baby-faced features. His unconventional background means he has few allies among Sudan’s political elites and military. But as a politician who also happens to own immensely valuable goldmines and run the largest private army in Africa – with about 70,000 soldiers at his disposal – this has not, at least until now, proved an insurmountable obstacle. Hemedti owns, along with other family members, a gold mining company that operates in lands he seized in Darfur 2017. In 2018, Bashir gave Hemedti permission to mine and sell gold, and operations extended to other gold rich areas in outside Darfur in the south of the country. The gold was exported, according to a 2019 Reuters investigation, circumventing capital controls, and even sold to the Sudanese central bank for a preferential rate. The yield was allegedly used to enrich Hemedti and his family, and fund the expansion of the RSF. (A spokesperson for Hemedti denied these allegations to Reuters.) Sudan is Africa’s third-largest producer of gold, and one of the poorest countries in the world. Yet the Dagalo fortune is not one that Hemedti, or the rest of his family, is discreet about. Hemedti sees no conflict between his political role and his business interests. “I’m not the first man to have goldmines,” he told the BBC in 2019. In a video posted last year, Hemedti’s cousin boasted that the Dagalos have become “one of Africa’s richest families”. Hemedti is also in the business of mercenaries. The RSF is an opaque mercenary force, which grew out of the Janjaweed militia, known for its atrocities in the Darfur war, and went on to become a formidable partner with the military in running Sudan. Over the past decade he has hired out his soldiers, some of them children, to Arab and African governments in need of troops for their own wars. Beyond a tool for domestic power and making money, the RSF gives Hemedti geopolitical power. By sending his forces to Yemen to support Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s war against Houthi rebels – by 2017, according to reports, there were as many as 40,000 RSF troops in Yemen – Hemedti secured powerful allies. After the revolution that ousted Bashir, Saudi Arabia and the UAE sent $3bn to stabilise the prospects of the military-RSF junta. That alliance extended into Libya, where in 2019, 1,000 RSF troops were sent to support UAE-allied forces of Khalifa Haftar in his offensive on Tripoli. The RSF has, for years, rendered Hemedti seemingly untouchable. “If you try to remove him by force,” Amjed Farid, a Sudanese political activist told me when we spoke in February, “that only means one thing: civil war.” Two months later, in an aggressive show of force, Hemedti demonstrated that his troops would indeed be unleashed if he felt threatened. No one knows when or where, exactly, Hemedti was born. Like many who hail from Sudan’s peripheries, his date of birth was not officially recorded, though he is thought to be in his late 40s. He claims to have born in Sudan, but his family, members of an Arab tribe of camel herders and traders, are said to have arrived in western Sudan’s Darfur region in the 1980s, having fled conflict and drought in Chad. Hemedti came of age in South Darfur, where his family eventually settled. He dropped out of school in the third grade, and later began to do business along Sudan’s porous borders with Libya and Egypt. He claims to have been a camel trader in his early years, though there are reasons to doubt this. “You will not find a single person in all of Darfur who will tell you he was a camel trader,” said Neimat al Mahdi, who lived in North Darfur at the time Hemedti claims he was trading camels, and now lives in the US after fleeing war in the region. “He was a highwayman. My father was a senior civil administrator in the region. All the camel traders would come to our town and insure their stock before setting off to sell it to Egypt and Libya. They were known names and families.” Any camels Hemedti ended up owning, she claimed, “were stolen from raids on camel processions on their way to the border”. After starting out in the camel and sheep trade, he eventually expanded into selling furniture and knick-knacks. At one point he owned a large furniture store in Nyala. And Hemedti’s story might have ended there – school dropout, nomadic traveller, camel trader and smalltime businessman. It was the start of the rebellion in Darfur that transformed his fortunes. The region, large and landlocked, straddles several climates and topographies. In the south there is rainfall and lush savanna, the centre is a plateau ringed by mountains, and the north is a sprawling desert. Established as an Islamic sultanate in 1596, Darfur’s history and identity long predates the creation of Sudan as a state, and it has never been fully integrated into wider Sudan proper. It is a region that is only noticed by the central government when it rebels, and then is oppressed into submission. The indigenous sedentary African peoples of Darfur and the nomadic Arabs have different cultures, identities, religious rituals and racial backgrounds, but have broadly coexisted for centuries. In the early 00s, however, competition for resources, precipitated by climate breakdown and desertification, triggered conflict between local groups. The influx of weaponry in the late 90s and early 00s, in part from the civil war in Chad along Darfur’s border, made the conflict bloodier. In 2003, as a result of prolonged drought, but also decades of misrule by central governments that favoured Arab tribes over others, Darfur’s disgruntled members of the non-Arab population turned to armed rebellion against the government. Bashir’s regime, only just emerging from a long civil war in the south of the country, decided that it was not going to engage directly with the rebel movement. Instead, it turned to a notorious force of Arab warriors, the Janjaweed, who were known for violently extracting land and resources from African tribes in the largely lawless region. The Janjaweed were drawn from the same background as Hemedti, camel-herding nomads who traversed the border between Sudan and Chad. In the Sudanese government, they found a powerful sponsor, one that could supply them with arms and power. In 2003, Hemedti, then in his late 20s, joined the Janjaweed. In a later interview with Sudanese TV, he claimed that members of his family had been killed by rebels in Darfur, which had spurred him to contact the government and offer himself as a recruit against rebels. His desire, he said, was to protect the camel-trading routes of his people and to protect Arabs who he claimed were being persecuted by African tribes. Already connected to Arab militias through family members, and to other Arab interests in the region through the camel business, Hemedti rose through the ranks of the Janjaweed to become an “emir”, leading crews that attacked non-Arab populations. “The period up to 2005 was a very difficult time,” Neimat al Mahdi told me. Resident in the town of Kabkabiya at the time, she saw first-hand the atrocities that the Janjaweed committed. They would enter a village of an African tribe, she said, kill all the men on sight and rape the women. Then they would tell the women: “You should celebrate, you slave. You are going to give birth to an Arab.” As a Janjaweed commander, Hemedti cultivated an image that played into mythologies of the desert warrior, drawing a turban across his face, wearing desert fatigues and modelling himself as a charismatic figure recruiting across tribes and fighting for their rights. The truth may be more prosaic. There is little evidence that Hemedti was ever passionate about the ideal of self-determination. He seems to have always been a canny strategist, and once he joined the armed conflict, leveraged his political activities to further his commercial aspirations. Over the next few years, Hemedti used his power in the region to extract more and more support from Khartoum. In 2007, he effectively blackmailed the government into extending him more resources by threatening to join the rebel movement. The government capitulated, and once an agreement was sealed, Hemedti was on his way to becoming not just an emir in an informal gang, but the head of a paramilitary force with weapons, uniforms, and budgets. He later admitted that his threats had all been a tactical ploy. “We didn’t really become rebels,” he told the journalist and researcher Jérôme Tubiana in 2009. “We just wanted to attract the government’s attention, tell them we’re here, in order to get our rights: military ranks, political positions, and development in our area.” This approach was what distinguished him from the rest of the Janjaweed, Tubiana told me. Hemedti was ambitious and had an aptitude for cutting deals. Other senior leaders were less cunning, and more rebellious. Hemedti, in Tubiana’s view, was not a freedom fighter, but a pragmatist who used the intersecting strands of Sudan’s conflicts to advance his interests. Hemedti got what he wanted from the government: the title of brigadier general, official ranks for his officers, and a large cash infusion – seed capital for his enterprise. His troops were put under the command of the government’s powerful intelligence unit, the National Intelligence and Security Service. Only six years after joining the Janjaweed, Hemedti was no longer a sun-scorched freelance mercenary, but a government official with an air-conditioned office. Over the next few years, Hemedti’s power and resources began to multiply. But his biggest asset by far, became his paramilitary army, the RSF. In 2013, after a resurgence of rebellions against Sudan’s central government in Darfur and elsewhere, Bashir decided to formally create the RSF, under the control of Hemedti. By that point, Hemedti already commanded a large force of Janjaweed, mercenaries and tribal loyalists. Bashir’s move was a way to regularise these troops, making it easier for him to outsource the government’s military activities to a separate army, with a separate budget. For Bashir, the RSF served two roles: first, as a praetorian guard, protecting him from threats from his own inner circle, and second, as a tool for crushing dissent in Sudan’s peripheries. There, the RSF relied on the same brutal tactics deployed by the Janjaweed during the Darfur war. This time, though, they had more weapons and air cover from the Sudanese army. A Human Rights Watch report found that in 2015, during two operations against civilians affiliated with rebel tribes, “the RSF committed a wide range of horrific abuses”, including “torture, extrajudicial killings and mass rapes”. In June 2019, the RSF deployed similarly brutal tactics against protesters in Khartoum. After the removal of Bashir in April, thousands of people that had taken part in a sit-in outside the government’s military headquarters in central Khartoum refused to budge. These protesters were not content with what they were being offered: a government made of up Bashir’s remnants in the army, the RSF, and the intelligence forces. They demanded the immediate instalment of a wholly civilian government, the return of the army to the barracks, and the dissolution of the RSF. By this stage, the military and the RSF had lost patience, and were not going to tolerate another large, drawn-out protest movement that would threaten their power, too. Bashir was dispensable, but they were not. In the early hours of the morning of 3 June, the power went out and the sit-in camp was attacked while the protesters were sleeping. Security forces led by the RSF began moving in, driving swiftly to the location in pickup trucks. Eyewitness reports and hundreds of smartphone videos captured the massacre. “They began shooting and setting tents on fire”, one of the protesters, Mohamed Madani, told me. “The gunfire didn’t stop.” Days after the attack, dozens of bodies secured with heavy weights were pulled out of the Nile River. “You used to chant the whole country is Darfur,” the militia said, after the attack, mocking the idealistic revolutionaries’ calls for solidarity with Darfur in the heady early days of the uprising in Khartoum. “Now we brought Darfur to you.” (Hemedti has denied ordering the killings.) The total number of casualties is still unknown. It was a traumatic event in Sudan’s recent political history, but in scale, it was small in comparison to what the RSF and similar militias, with the support of government, had visited on Sudan’s civilians away from scrutiny in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The weeks after the June 2019 massacre were a period of hectic negotiation between the RSF, the army and civilian leaders represented by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC), as they tried to hash out a transitional arrangement that would appease protesters, stabilise the country and set a new course for Sudan. In July, a power-sharing agreement was reached, and in August, a civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, was selected, with the intention of working with Hemedti and Burhan to steer the country towards democratic elections in three years. The government was shaky. After a few initial gains, such as securing the removal of Sudan from the US’s state sponsors of terror list in late 2020, and the promise of debt relief from the World Bank, the RSF and the military started to grow tired of what Burhan called “in-fighting” between them and the civilians, and between civilian parties themselves. In mid-2021, someone who was working closely with the prime minister at the time told me that the civilian component was “weak” and splintered, and that the soldiers still retained ultimate control. In the same period, another civilian government staffer told me that Hamdok, a gentle technocrat who made his name working in international organisations, was not aggressive enough to stand up to the two generals, and so was beginning to lose his credibility. By October 2021, the generals had had enough, took power and detained the prime minister and others in his cabinet. The coup was not a success. Protests erupted, were violently suppressed, then erupted again, week in, week out. The international community, which had begun to bring Sudan in from the cold, stopped aid and funding. The African Union suspended Sudan’s membership, and the generals found themselves running a fiercely restive country and a deteriorating economy, while also failing to trust each other fully. Hemedti began to suspect that Islamists from Bashir’s regime were infiltrating the army. He established close ties with contacts in Russia, meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov the day of the Ukraine invasion, but it was clearly not enough to decisively strengthen his position against the army, either through extensive arms purchases or funding. By the middle of 2022, both generals had begun to make overtures to civilian leaders once again, in the hope that a new deal with civilians would buy them some time and options. Burhan needed to figure out how to remove the threat of the RSF and bring it under the umbrella of the army. Hemedti needed to find a way to embed himself more securely within the senior offices of the state, through running for election for example, without fear of military ambush, but also without relinquishing his soldiers. The FFC came back to the table, and in December 2022, civilian parties signed a framework agreement, to be finalised in April. The deal promised the civilians, against all the evidence of the past two years, that the generals would relinquish power. Hemedti, however, would soon grow to believe this was a trap. In February, I had arrived in Khartoum hoping to meet with Hemedti. I had made contact with his team via former members of the civilian government, but was warned that Hemedti would probably not give me an audience because he had been hurt by previous encounters with the press. After the 2019 revolution that thrust him into the spotlight, Hemedti had launched a media campaign to burnish his image, but he was not satisfied with the results. He hired a Canadian public relations firm for an upfront fee of $6m, and opened his large headquarters in south Khartoum to visiting media, offering them meals and regaling them with accounts of how he and his forces intervened to save the country from anarchy. The charm offensive didn’t work. “All people wanted to print was that he was a killer and had no education,” a middleman who had introduced him to a western journalist in the past told me. If Hemedti is sensitive about his outsider status, the mockery he is subjected to within Sudan, and particularly Khartoum, most likely does not help. A wave of social media memes follows his public speeches, making fun of his accent and expression. Pictures of him in his old Darfur days looking bedraggled circulate on WhatsApp groups, captioned with derisory comments. Hemedti was a hinterland village clown to the Arab elites of central Sudan, the so called “riverine tribes”, descendants of Arabs who migrated from the Arabian peninsula in the 12th century and intermarried with Indigenous populations along the banks of the Nile River, which runs through the centre of Sudan. These groups, who have dominated government and state bureaucracy since independence in 1956, are not accustomed to people such as Hemedti at the seat of power. In forcing Bashir to step aside, Hemedti overturned an agreement that underwrote Sudanese politics for generations. The elites of the centre have the political power, and their partners in the peripheries enforce their agendas, but remain in the background. At the end of February, I received a surprising message from my contacts: Hemedti would talk to me after all, but only in a particular setting – on his farm on the outskirts of Khartoum, and not at RSF headquarters in the city. The tension was rising between him and Burhan as the April deadline for finalising the framework agreement loomed, and they were nowhere close to agreement on one major sticking point – when and how to incorporate the RSF into the army. Against this backdrop, I was told that Hemedti was keen to get his account of events across. But in early March he suddenly departed on a series of unscheduled foreign trips to the UAE and Eritrea, in hindsight perhaps an effort to drum up regional support for his campaign against the army. Over the next few days, as we awaited Hemedti’s return, I spent time with his inner circle, who were nestled in plush offices and villas in affluent parts of the city, in buildings that all seemed hastily and expensively furnished, and only recently inhabited. The people I met were lavishly supported by bodyguards, drivers and young female personal assistants. Despite these shows of wealth, Hemedti’s close allies seemed to think of themselves as plucky outsiders who cut their teeth in the crucible of Sudan’s wars, far away from the decadent capital and its corrupt network of traditional political elites. One of them told me of having escaped the scene of a massacre in Darfur, only to come to Khartoum and be dazed by the dissonance of seeing people dining, partying and going about their lives, oblivious to what was happening only hours away in their own country. They all spoke of Hemedti as a misunderstood figure, a generous man living frugally, preoccupied with the interests of the Sudanese people and battling the devious propaganda of Burhan and his shadowy cabal of Islamist allies. They maintained that a “deep state”, made up of the powerful remnants of Bashir’s regime and the army, was working to eliminate him. Despite all the power that Hemedti had amassed, he was a stressed man under siege, they said. He had realised that troops, money and arms weren’t enough to establish him firmly in power. By early April, as the deadline for finalising the agreement with the civilians and the military approached, it became clear that commitment to the deal was ebbing away. The army backtracked on previous statements, declaring that it would not cede power to a civilian authority unless it was elected. Crucial points, such as the timing of the RSF’s integration into the army, and Hemedti’s own position within it, became contentious. Hemedti accused the army of dragging its feet and “clinging on to power”. In turn, an army spokesperson stated: “We cannot make an agreement when there are two armies in the country.” It is not clear exactly when the last shred of trust disappeared, or who fired first, but three days before hostilities began, the RSF had begun to deploy more troops to Khartoum and to quietly reinforce its positions in the strategic northern city of Merowe. On Saturday 15 April, the first day of hostilities, the RSF troops captured Merowe airport and airbase, and appeared to take over Khartoum airport and the presidential palace. The army’s military headquarters were also attacked, and by Sunday morning the building was on fire. The army turned to its major advantage over the RSF, aerial firepower, and deployed jets that rained missiles on RSF positions across the centre of the city, against buildings and clusters of militiamen nestled close to civilian areas. The fighting flared up simultaneously in other parts of Sudan, not just in the north, but once again in Darfur, in the cities of Nyala and Al Fashir. Hemedti had junked the deal as a way for him to consolidate his power, and reverted to what he knows best: fighting. That fighting seems partly animated by Hemedti’s bitterness at how he has been treated by his former partners in the army, and by Burhan personally, the man whose death he relished in that first interview after the conflict began. From the third day of the conflict, RSF troops began entering houses in Khartoum, pillaging, looting and assaulting civilians. Such actions suggest a force that is hostile not just to the army, but the inhabitants of a city, and a wider ethnic heartland that had never welcomed them, a bloody expression of Hemedti’s vengeance. Not even a week after the hostilities began, civilian casualties have risen to nearly 300, the deaths concentrated in Khartoum, the site of the most intense fighting. Some died by bullets that ricocheted into their homes, others trying to make their way across the city to safety. The rest of the city’s population are running out of food and water, and sleeping, if they can, far away from windows as the constant barrage of gun fire rattles outside their homes. Meanwhile, the army indiscriminately showers both Hemedti’s militia and the Sudanese people with bombs, as it fights an existential battle on behalf of a ruling class desperately trying to eliminate a man who is both its creation, and its punishment.

       " 'As the legendary actor turns 86 on Saturday, we rate decades of his most celebrated roles – from grinning wrong ’uns to lovable rakes and crazed murderers Despite being a colossal platform for Warren Beatty as its director-star – perhaps the high point of his Hollywood prestige – this epic about John Reed and the October Revolution featured Jack Nicholson on scene-stealing, smouldering form as the dramatist Eugene O’Neill, who was painfully in love with Reed’s lover and then wife Louise Bryant, played by Diane Keaton. Nicholson was deep into his grinning-devil mode for this movie, based on the John Updike novel – a mode to which he brought charisma and force, but not much depth. He is the satanically alluring bachelor Darryl Van Horne, who moves into a small New England community and forms a connection with three women who don’t realise they are witches, played by Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon. John Huston’s hitman-hitwoman black comedy caper, anticipating the Mr & Mrs Smith shenanigans of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie 20 years later, was considered a brilliantly irreverent satirical take on the mafia, almost The Sopranos of its day. Nicholson is super-cool as the mid-ranking wiseguy falling in love with a beautiful woman (Kathleen Turner). Then they are contracted to whack each other. Monte Hellman shot these microbudget western cult classics back to back in the Utah desert. Nicholson produced and starred in both and wrote Ride in the Whirlwind. In The Shooting, he is the disturbing, black-clad gunslinger who menacingly follows a woman and the two men she has hired to accompany her. In Ride in the Whirlwind, he is a potent part of an outlaw trio. Alongside his saturnine reputation for thrillers, tragedies, dark sexiness and general atavistic threat, Nicholson has long had a parallel career as the reformable rake in romantic comedies – could he have a heart of gold, despite that mad-bad-and-dangerous-to-know image? Here, he plays opposite another alpha-plus star, Meryl Streep, in Nora Ephron’s autobiographical marital breakup comedy. “YOU CAN’T HANDLE THE TRUTH!” Jack Nicholson’s ferocious Col Nathan Jessup erupts from the court-martial witness stand under questioning from the wide-eyed idealist Tom Cruise, pursuing the suspicion that Nicholson’s high-ranking officer directly sanctioned violence and abuse. Another Nicholson scene-stealer. In David Mamet’s take on the classic James M Cain noir, tougher than the 1946 version, Nicholson’s sexy-threat image is cranked up as the drifter who has an obsessive affair with Jessica Lange, the young wife of an old gas-station owner – and agrees to kill him. Lange and Nicholson have a raunchy sex scene on the kitchen table, covered in flour, which the first film’s star, Lana Turner, condemned as “pornographic trash”. One of the grandstanders of Nicholson’s late-career phase, in which he is settling into paunchy disillusionment, rage, fear, loneliness and a kind of wrecked and desperately salvaged decency. He plays the ageing police detective Jerry Black, who, on his last day on the job, is called to a brutal child murder and promises the distraught mother he will find the killer, which becomes his obsession. James L Brooks gave Nicholson a huge character turn in his bittersweet romantic comedy-drama constructed around his persona, which by this time had gone past the larger-than-life stage and was something else entirely: a one-man Mount Rushmore of movie stardom. He is the cantankerous novelist with OCD and a need to insult and belittle everyone, including Helen Hunt’s waitress and Greg Kinnear’s gay artist. Nicholson and Martin Scorsese is a mouthwatering combination. The result, although perhaps not the classic everyone hoped for, was a barnstormer. Scorsese remade the Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs about the parallel lives of a young cop and a criminal undercover in the mob and the police respectively. Nicholson is Frank Costello, the jeering, grinning, snarling capo – the Pavarotti of organised crime. This was the movie that established 32-year-old Nicholson’s unique position in movies: intense, distinctive and seductive, the hair already starting to thin and the alligator grin beginning to make itself felt. Nicholson (who co-wrote the screenplay) is more than a character player, but hardly a pretty-boy lead. He is the wealthy, alcoholic human-rights lawyer George Hanson, who helps out the two counterculture bikers Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, but is always getting thrown in the drunk tank himself. Nicholson played the Joker in an era when the superhero franchise wasn’t bigger than the star. He is the supervillain that the others (Heath Ledger, Joaquin Phoenix) were later measured against: the gurning, grinning, purple-clad bad guy whose capering craziness effortlessly upstaged Michael Keaton’s more demure Dark Knight. He is given a preposterous origin myth: this Joker was a mobster and hoodlum called Jack Napier (the JN initials leaning into Nicholson’s bad-boy status) who fell into a chemical vat during a shootout in a pharmaceuticals factory, causing his face to convulse into that hideous grin. One of Nicholson’s great outlaw-dissident roles. US Navy Signalman Billy Buddusky, alongside Gunner’s Mate Richard Mulhall (Otis Young), is detailed to accompany a pathetic teenage recruit (Randy Quaid) across the country to a military prison in Maine for an eight-year sentence. They have a week to deliver their man. With crazy, hilarious recklessness, Nicholson decides to show the poor guy a good time before he goes away for his ordeal; inevitably, it involves far more illegality than the relatively petty theft that got the kid into trouble in the first place. Nicholson is an actor with an intensely American sensibility, but he made one of his best films with that European mandarin of high arthouse cinema, Michelangelo Antonioni. The Passenger is a Greeneian tale of a world-weary reporter in Chad. Depressed about his life, he switches identities with a dead man in a neighbouring hotel room. The man turns out to be an arms dealer. Nicholson’s existential antihero fatalistically embraces his identity, knowing it can lead only to violent death, which he accepts with ecstatic calm. “Heeeeeere’s Johnny!” Generations who have no idea who Johnny Carson is know this is the blood-curdling cry of Nicholson’s Jack Torrance as he axes down a door, the grinning psychopath made legendary by the movie’s poster showing Shelley Duvall’s fear-stricken face on the opposite side. They are the couple with a young son who become the off-season caretakers of the remote Overlook hotel – and are plunged into the horror sense-memory that saturates the building. Stephen King was unimpressed by this adaptation; some argue that, like the famous closing image of Nicholson, it effectively froze the actor into a crazy-guy persona that was difficult to shake. But the destructive power of his performance is undeniable. The producer, Michael Douglas, had the difficult task of telling his dad, Kirk, who had created the role on stage, that it would be going to Nicholson for the movie. Nicholson made the role iconic and it made him a megastar – a cousin to his character from The Last Detail. He was the rock’n’roll wildman McMurphy, sent down for statutory rape, whose troubled personality gets him a transfer to a mental institution. He leads a revolt against the clinical regime and faces off with a worthy opponent: the terrifying Nurse Ratched, played by Louise Fletcher. Bob Rafelson’s underrated masterpiece and jewel of the American New Wave features a wonderfully subtle and introspective performance from Nicholson – the kind that he was later increasingly unwilling or unable to attempt. He is David, a gloomy and self-important radio talkshow host in Philadelphia, given to long, literary, self-indulgent monologues about his life and opinions. Bruce Dern is his rackety and disreputable brother, Jason, who is dating a former beauty queen played by the excellent Ellen Burstyn, who needs David to come to Atlantic City and bail him out of jail. The odd-couple energy between Nicholson and Dern is palpable and their dialogue is a joy. Nicholson’s performance as the Los Angeles private detective Jake Gittes in this remarkable 30s neo-noir from Roman Polanski was worthy of Bogart – although hyperactive in a way Bogart wasn’t. He gave us another famous image: the slashed and bandaged nose, showing you what happens to people who stick their noses into dangerous business. This louche and seedy gumshoe, in his white suit, falls in love with the mysterious shady lady Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway), whose troubled psychology is at the centre of film’s plot as Nicholson’s detective investigates a corrupt conspiracy in California’s Department of Water and Power. Yet there is something poignant, even tragic, in this tough guy’s inability to grasp the swirl of sexual dysfunction that lies beneath everything: the insoluble Chinatown of the title. This poignant Alexander Payne tragicomedy is Nicholson’s late-career masterpiece; he described it as the most free from egotism he has ever performed. He is Warren Schmidt: an angry, disappointed, depressed old widower who had always secretly resented being chivvied by his late wife, who had made him sit down on the lavatory to urinate; the sight of Nicholson actually doing this on screen is awe-inspiring. Schmidt finds himself on a mean-spirited mission to sabotage his grownup daughter’s wedding to a man he doesn’t like, but he is also making regular charity donations to a disadvantaged six-year-old in Tanzania. Having been encouraged to enclose a personal letter with each payment, Schmidt finds that this has become a journal of self-expression and self-inspection. For the first time, he is thinking about what his life means. Here is the single devastating performance that seems to give us all of what makes Nicholson such a radioactive screen presence: the truculence, the sexiness, the insolence, the irrepressible wit and craziness, the unexpected sensitivity, the sadness, the anger and the desolate self-reproach. He is Bobby Dupea, a failed classical pianist who, in his resentment and rage at his own aborted career, abandons his vocation and refined upper-middle-class family to become an oil-rigger out west, trapped in a toxic relationship and hanging out with people who have no idea of what he used to be. His snarky, needling manner comes out in that memorable scene where he mocks a waitress for the apparent difficulties in meeting his demand for toast. Finally, Bobby must come home (with his girlfriend) when his father has a stroke. His angry, painful encounter with his home and his past is unforgettable.',\n",
       " 'Less than 1% of reported rapes lead to a conviction. But this was the case for Wilson – who then waived her anonymity to expose the problems in the criminal justice system On 26 May last year, Ellie Wilson sat in the witness room of the high court in Glasgow, waiting to be called. As chief witness, the rape victim in the trial of her ex-boyfriend Daniel McFarlane, her anxiety was off the scale. “Any time the door would knock, I’d have this flash of black across my vision and the room would kind of spin,” she says. “It was the weirdest physiological experience. I was terrified in a way I had never been before. Then the clerk comes in dressed in robes and brings you into the court … I feel scared just thinking about it.” Wilson, now 25, has experienced a rare thing: her rapist was not only prosecuted but found guilty. Though research shows that one in four women have been raped or sexually assaulted as adults, it is estimated that only one in six will report it and less than 1% of reported cases end in a conviction. The few who do see their rapist jailed rarely wish to share the experience but Wilson does – her friends call her “Ellie Telly”. Through Twitter, TikTok, the press, Panorama and BBC Scotland she is sharing what she has been through and how so much needs to change. She has crowdfunded to make a complaint against the defence advocate (defending barrister) in her trial. She is lobbying Scottish parliament for policy change and better safeguarding in universities. Most important for Wilson though is to just keep on talking so that other rape victims have some idea of what to expect when navigating the system. “Because I had absolutely no idea at all,” she says. “I went in knowing it would be difficult but it was harder than I thought. I didn’t expect it to be so personal.” Conviction rates are far lower for date rapes than stranger rapes and Wilson had been in a relationship with McFarlane for more than two years. Both were students at Glasgow University – Wilson studying politics, McFarlane medicine – they had met in September 2017 through the athletics club. “I’d been going through a difficult time at the club and Daniel offered to coach me,” she says. “He was a really good athlete, better than me and very quickly he was my best friend.” Three months later, while still just friends, he raped her. It was New Year’s Eve, they had been out partying and Wilson was drunk and had passed out in her bed when it happened. “I had a bad feeling the next day,” she says. “I woke up feeling something bad had happened but almost didn’t want to speak it into existence. I pushed it to the back of my mind because if I thought about it in any detail, everything would change and I couldn’t deal with the consequences of that.” Soon after, they became a couple. The relationship was studded with jealous rows, temporary breakups and more abuse. On one occasion, Wilson refused sex because she had a UTI. McFarlane raped her anyway. She didn’t recognise this as domestic violence. “That’s something you maybe associate with older married couples,” she says. “When you’re young, it’s very easy to romanticise the kind of relationship we had. Your boyfriend should be crazy about you to the extent that they’re actually crazy!” “It was a rollercoaster. When it was good, it was really good, but when it was bad, it was really, really, really bad. You’re like a drug addict. You want your fix. You just want it to be good again. I still maintain that I’ll probably never love anyone as much as I loved him – but that’s a good thing.” She later learned that McFarlane had raped her on that first New Year’s Eve. He had told her in a text message the following summer: “PS The reason I told you you have probably been raped while drunk sleeping is because I did it.” Another time, with her phone recording their conversation while hidden in her bag, she’d asked how he felt about raping her. McFarlane replied: “I feel good knowing I’m not in prison.” “I made that recording partly for my own sanity,” says Wilson. “I wanted the truth for when I doubted myself.” She also knew this was hard evidence should she ever need it – though it was another year before the relationship ended. Wilson is very clear on why she stayed with McFarlane for so long. “Abuse doesn’t make you love someone less,” she says. “Often, it makes you love them more because it isolates you and makes you more dependent. He is the only person in the world who knows what you’re going through – and often he is the person that comforts you afterwards.” During her time with McFarlane, Wilson became, she says, “a ghost” and “unrecognisable”. She had spent a week in hospital after an attempted suicide, had stopped going to classes and was retaking her final year by the time she ended all contact with him. This was March 2020, going into lockdown, and in that quiet space, she began healing and started to think about pursuing justice. “I wrote everything down and seeing it in words made it clear. He was doing a medical degree so it was partly for the safety of other people, but it’s also fair and right to want justice for myself.” Within a week of Wilson’s police interview, McFarlane was arrested and charged. Next came a two-year wait for the case to reach trial. “I knew that cases such as these were supposed to be heard in a year, but I was told that the Covid backlog meant it would be a lot longer,” says Wilson. “It’s like a cloud hanging over you, it’s never out of your mind.” Still, for the first year, Wilson felt she was doing well – she focused on her master’s and got a distinction and began working in the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh. McFarlane had been suspended from Glasgow University so she assumed he would be back home in the Highlands on bail. Then she saw on social media that he was in Edinburgh, too. He’d been offered a place at Edinburgh University despite their awareness of his impending trial. When you are living close to the man who has been charged with your rape – as many victims do during the long wait for trial – every day is traumatising. “Walking in public was terrifying for me,” says Wilson. “I would see his face on men’s faces in the streets. I’d freeze regularly, burst into tears at random moments. I started crying in front of the MSP I worked for. I had a really big scar on my arm as I chose to hurt myself instead of killing myself. I’d done all this healing, taken these steps forward and now I was going backwards.” She was shocked by the absence of support available. “I knew that accessing mental health services is really difficult but I thought in these circumstances, when you’re going to court, there must be something, some sort of funding. There’s nothing.” As the trial approached, Wilson struggled with suicidal thoughts. “I was terrified about how I would cope if he was found not guilty,” she says. “That was the big thing – to not be believed. If he was acquitted, it would be as if I’m being told it didn’t happen and that was the most painful thing in the world for me. I couldn’t live in a world that would let someone do that.” When Wilson finally gave evidence, separated from McFarlane by a screen, she had no idea what lines of questioning to expect. “It’s not you v him – it’s the crown v him, so there’s no one talking to you about the case beforehand. You’re not allowed to be given any information.” The prosecutor’s questions took two hours. Then came the defence advocate – his questions to Wilson took two days. Though Wilson had fully expected her accounts of the rapes to be challenged, it was still excruciating to hear. “He was massaging your buttocks and touching you in that area, you became very wet and that … led on to intercourse … maybe it was sore because you had this UTI, and so you were crying but you didn’t stop him …” What she hadn’t expected was what felt like a character assassination. “The prosecution focused on facts,” says Wilson. “The defence was very different. He was charismatic, theatrical – he was more concerned with painting a picture.” That picture showed, in the defence’s words, “a straight-A student from a nice Christian background” who’d “fallen in love” with an arch-manipulator. “He made a big thing that Daniel was a virgin when we met and I wasn’t,” says Wilson. “Respect in court is so important. We call the judge ‘My Lord’ and stand when he enters the room. But the defence kept calling me ‘this girl’.” “This girl, what do you know about her?” he asked the jury. “This is a girl without empathy all right!” He asked Wilson if she liked to make McFarlane jealous. He asked about her drinking and what she wore to bed. He asked if she had narcissistic personality disorder – not based on medical evidence, just his own analysis. Then he asked if she’d heard of cluster B personality disorders – the judge instructed Wilson not to answer. The case lasted six days. Wilson held her nerve and answered well – although that seemed to count against her in the defence’s closing speech. “She’s the strong one!” he said at one point. “I suggest to you that she can manipulate … You saw how she was with me! Daniel had to put up with that for two and a half years!” McFarlane was found guilty – although the verdict wasn’t unanimous, even with a recorded confession included as evidence. “It was an immense relief,” says Wilson. She chose to attend the sentencing. “I wanted to walk into court and show I hadn’t been defeated.” McFarlane was now a convicted rapist but you wouldn’t know it when his defence advocate set out the mitigation plea. “Tragically, he went to university … he hadn’t even kissed a girl before then and he fell in love with the wrong person … They were like chalk and cheese, my lord … Their life experiences were very, very different … All this was a relationship that wasn’t going well.” “The word ‘rape’ was used once in that whole speech, the word ‘love’ was used six times,” says Wilson. “There had already been a guilty verdict but I had to listen in silence to what was essentially a tirade against me.” McFarlane was sentenced to five years. McFarlane’s defence advocate did not respond to the Guardian’s approach for comment. Unlike with Wilson, more than six rape and sexual assault cases are discontinued every week as complainants withdraw their support – in many cases due to waiting for a court date that can stretch up to three years – which is about a third higher than nine years ago. Partly to address this, England and Wales is rolling out prerecorded evidence, where rape victims can give evidence and have their cross-examination as close to the time of reporting as possible, when memories are fresh and to avoid the long wait and trauma of open court. Scotland is considering a range of measures including specialist sexual violence courts with judge-only trials. Advocacy and support groups such as the Centre for Women’s Justice and Rape Crisis have pointed out that the current system incentivises defence advocates to destroy a complainant’s credibility and undermine them in any way possible. Plenty of research has shown that rape myths are alive and well in the average jury – ideas about how “genuine” victims would behave, what they would wear, how much they would drink – so the defence’s best chance is to play to them. “I can see the argument for a panel of judges,” says Wilson, “but there are simple, less controversial things we can do, like ensuring defence questioning doesn’t cross the line and that complainants are treated with dignity and respect. We could ensure they have access to psychological support.” In order to make a complaint against McFarlane’s defence advocate, Wilson needed a copy of the court transcript, which was only available at a cost of £3,000 plus VAT. She raised this through crowdfunding and is now campaigning to abolish this prohibitive expense for victims of crime. “All it does is perpetuate the secrecy around the court.” She is also in discussion with Ucas and the Scottish government over the admission of students to university when they have serious criminal records or are awaiting trial. In truth all this action is a kind of therapy. “The trauma will never go away,” says Wilson. “I need to pour all this energy and hurt somewhere. Of course I want change, but if I can help one person who is going through this feel less alone, then that means so much.” It also helps drown out the thoughts that sometimes surface in the quieter moments. She is still trying to make sense of it all. “I worry about him in prison, I feel guilty about the bright future he had, scared about him hurting himself,” she says. “But then I think about the person I was and what he took from me and all I’ve had to go through since. I need to remind myself that justice is something worth celebrating.”  In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support for rape and sexual abuse on 0808 802 9999 in England and Wales, 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland.

       " 'Even enthusiastic athletes can fall into a rut. Here, readers and experts offer their best motivation tips, from getting a dog to fleeing zombies Even if you like exercise, it can be a drudge. But there are plenty of ways to mix up your regime to make it more joyful. Here is what works for readers, athletes and fitness experts. Samantha Clayton (née Davies), who represented Great Britain in athletics at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, admits to “feeling dread” before some workouts. Her remedy? “I fit in group classes at least twice a week. Training alone is so tough, even for the most seasoned exerciser. The best gift you can give yourself is the gift of community.” While lockdown revolutionised home workouts in a way not seen since the 1980s, a 2017 study found that you will probably work harder and get more out of the experience if you go to an in-person class. Also, synchronicity during exercise, be it movements in an aerobics class or breathing in yoga, has been shown to provide a boost. Cate Duffy, from west London, attends Quit the Gym at her local park, which has helped her train for a half marathon: “The best bit is the banter and support from the community of all ages, backgrounds and fitness levels,” she says. “I always finish the class smiling. It’s more like playtime.” Then, of course, there is parkrun. Participants report improved physical and mental health, while volunteers achieve even higher happiness levels. If it becomes a habit, the personal bests and endorphins will keep on coming. A 2019 study by Brunel University found that music increased participants’ enjoyment of exercise by almost one-third. It has also been found to reduce the perception of exertion. Music is better than a podcast or audiobook. Although any music will do, synching movement to a well-curated playlist of your favourite tunes is most uplifting. The disability activist and inclusive-dance champion Kate Stanforth chooses songs based on beats per minute. “I have playlists divided into tempos, so that, on a day I’m not doing so well, I can still play upbeat songs I love, but at a slower pace. On a day I’m feeling good, I have the option to dance or cycle faster. I also find that getting through a song, or a chorus, is better for me than focusing on calories, time or speed.” Clayton also uses music to get in the zone. “When I’m trying to find the motivation for a workout, I rely heavily on my playlist and pre-workout drink to get me fired up. Also, a little caffeine can go a long way in energising your body to push through. A drop of peppermint essential oil on my wrist wakes up my brain and improves my focus.” Lewis Ridley, who lives in Liverpool, was one of the many people who took up running during lockdown. “After initially finding it really difficult, I had a breakthrough after hearing on the radio Jimmy from Running Punks, the online running community,” he says. “It connects people through a shared love of running and music.” As Caroline Williams, the author of Move: The New Science of Body Over Mind, puts it: “The simple act of moving yourself forward through space does some surprisingly profound things to the way you think and feel. Studies have got people to walk forward through space and found it distorts our perception of time – it makes it feel like the past is further behind you and you are physically moving into the future.” This makes it harder to think of negative things. “One of the easiest ways to motivate yourself is to get up and move forwards – it can really change the way you feel.” Dance is a particularly effective way of finding pleasure while exercising, says Williams. “We have this idea that dance has to be something you are great at,” she says, but leaping around your kitchen does the job fine. “You think you are going to fall and then you don’t – and that feels really good.” Anya, from Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, never danced as a child, but took up ballet at 30. “I was terrible at social dancing and realised I had no body vocabulary,” she says. “My legs went from jelly to strong pillars of support in a few months. Being able to control muscles and motion so finely is completely new to me. Every class, I gain a bit more ability. When I can do one thing just slightly better, I smile ecstatically.” There are many benefits to exercising outdoors, from improving your mood and your sleep to reducing stress. Exercising in nature not only increases our connection with the natural world, but also exposes us to the associated sensations of awe, which are well documented for their mood-enhancing properties. Embrace the warmer weather and get out there. For some, joyful exercise is a matter of building it into daily life. Phil Langton, in Bath, walks or cycles nearly everywhere and never takes a lift. “If I need to work a few other muscles, I use an elastic strap while the kettle boils, rather than weights.” The more you do it, the more tolerable it becomes. April Brown, from Hitchin in Hertfordshire, manages to squeeze in 30 miles of running a week and four sessions of high-intensity interval training, along with daily yoga. “There’s no better feeling than being fit and strong,” she says. Swim the Channel, take part in an Ironman or even strip off for a naked 5k. Participation events make you feel like an Olympian and are the perfect motivation to keep training on the hardest of days. Even better: raise money while doing it. Four months ago, Jonathan Wilson, from York, started on blood pressure tablets at 60 after “decades of denial”. His fitness goal was to lose weight and perhaps get off his medication. “Every week, some more weight comes off, I write it down and plot a chart – that’s all the motivation I need.” Whether the prize is food or the final episode of a box set, there is no harm in incentivising activities. You will enjoy your treat all the more for knowing you have worked for it. During physical activity, dopamine is released in the brain’s reward system, which fosters feelings of optimism. This is not limited to running. Exercise is known to trigger various parts of the brain that bring pleasure and other benefits, including stress relief, connectedness and courage. Find out what gets you to that place. Breathwork is helpful on many levels. When exercising, engage your diaphragm for deeper breathing that will bring more oxygen to your body, help you push harder and avoid stitches. Try apps such as Calm or Headspace to practise mindfulness techniques that can help you to focus, get through the tougher moments of your workout and generally feel more in touch with your body. Fiona Brennan, from Worcester, says she always struggled to keep up a fitness regime until she discovered the app Zombies, Run!. As the name suggests, “you escape zombies, uncover a story and feel a part of it”, she says. She loves it so much that she ran every day in January. “I now willingly do speed training, the most evil of all runs.” Alternatively, make map art on Strava. Dominate your fitness app leaderboards. Orienteer. We are playful, competitive creatures. Zed, from Glasgow, says he finds “great joy in being chucked around several times a week by the men and women of all ages that I now call friends at a mixed martial arts club. It’s a good way to break away from the monotony of spreadsheets, while the technical aspects of learning new skills and strategies challenge my mind and body. Truly the game of human chess.” Dan Weston runs around Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire and beyond with his dog, Kali. “If I need any nudge to get out, it’s usually enough knowing how much she gets out of it,” he says. “The ‘flow state’, when we are on a trail, cruising along, is unbeatable.” In a study of older couples who exercised together, they reported feeling closer after a session, due to the sense of collective joy that doing fitness with others brings. Athleisure wear has never been better. Whether you want to dress like you are heading for Centre Court at Wimbledon or like Jane Fonda, you can take on a whole new identity while keeping fit. Ditch the apps, watches and headphones and exercise free, escaping modern technology – if only for half an hour. After a 20-year hiatus, Emily Bristow, from Newport in Wales, got back into tennis in 2021 when she lost both parents: “I threw myself into it, playing doubles in the women’s league and winning a few promotions. Last summer, I entered the club’s women’s singles tournament, having finished runner-up as a junior more times than I can remember. This time, I won it. It was a huge achievement for me.” Grace Birchall, from Ruislip in west London, swears by netball. “Team sport is the most fun version of exercise, where you aren’t even aware that you are working out. If we have a match or training, there is so much more riding on whether I turn up or not for my team than if I did it alone.” She recommends the scheme Back to Netball for anyone keen to get into it again as an adult. Trapeze, kayaking, pickleball. The less familiar it is, the less you will notice the work involved. Head to TikTok, where personal trainers and influencers are trialling everything from wall pilates to soft hiking and treadmill struts. Andrew Vermes swims every day, mostly in a local pool in Sussex, but also in open water, off Brighton pier or in Lake Balaton in Hungary. “It is a bit like meditation,” he says. “I focus on the small things all the time: the angle of my hands, my breathing, the cadence of kicks, the feeling of the water as I move. I try to change these to see what happens and keep the exercise interesting.” Bex Evans, from Bristol, finds weightlifting much more satisfying than other forms of fitness. “Even if it’s adding just 1kg more to the bar, or being able to squeeze out one more rep than last week, it’s all progress. It’s a great weekly mood-boost that makes you feel super-strong and powerful.” Nadia Gilani, the author of The Yoga Manifesto, says exercise should be a tool for feeling better about life. “If you think you should be practising yoga, meditating or going to the gym, but find yourself not wanting to, it might be worth finding something else that you’re drawn to and pursuing that. If something doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. It’s usually a sign that it’s time for a different approach.” Alan Russell, a fitness instructor in County Durham, says not to fight your personality or genetics. “When you find an activity that resonates with your body and mind, you will love doing it and find others who love it, too. The worst of fitness is trying to make you something you’re not. Celebrate who you are.” Russell adds: “I don’t have a set plan for workouts, just a rough outline. Some days, I won’t feel like doing heavy weights, so I switch to light weights and go with high reps. If I start to put on body fat, I increase my cardio and dial back the weights. If I’m tired, I take the day off. Having to follow a set plan every workout would kill the joy.” Take a different route on your cycle, vary your gym programme, try a new class. Mix it up. Excessive alcohol intake can play havoc with hydration and fatigue, inhibiting performance and satisfaction levels. A bad workout is not a fun one. Don’t overdo it. Seek advice when you are injured. Rest when you are unwell. Whatever you manage to do, feel proud that you did anything at all. There is a certain level of enjoyment in that itself – and the knowledge that, afterwards, you can chill.',\n",
       " 'Scottish National party was outwardly successful but behind the scenes it was chaotic, say insiders The first day back at Holyrood after Easter recess should have been the moment for Scotland’s new leader, Humza Yousaf, to reset the agenda after a bruising leadership contest. Instead, hours before his first big policy statement on Tuesday, Yousaf found himself besieged by reporters asking questions about the arrest of the SNP treasurer, Colin Beattie, earlier that morning, and having to insist that while Beattie’s arrest was a “very serious matter”, people were “innocent until proven guilty”. The clamour was further evidence of a Scottish National party in chaos. Just two weeks earlier, its former chief executive Peter Murrell – the husband of Yousaf’s predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon – had also been arrested, with police dramatically raiding the couple’s home and erecting a tent to gather evidence in the garden. The arrests are part of a police inquiry into the SNP’s handling of more than £600,000 in donations raised to campaign for a second independence referendum, but allegedly used for day-to-day running costs instead. It is no repeat of the Westminster MPs’ expenses scandal, but the criminal allegations still raise the prospect of financial wrongdoing. Now MSPs, activists and officials are asking soul-searching questions, many of which boil down to: how could a national party, leading Scotland’s battle for independence from the UK, have been allowed to descend into such turmoil? “Some people are still in shock, some are in denial, some are saying ‘what the fuck?’” says one senior politician representing the north of Scotland. Speaking to a wide range of elected representatives, activists and officials, almost all refer to the explosion in membership that took place immediately after Scotland’s first independence referendum of 2014 as the pivot point for a party where governance – as one ex-minister put it – “became nonexistent”. “The party depended on the old mechanisms for too long and that’s why we are in deep shit,” says a former national executive committee member bluntly. Despite being in government at Holyrood since 2007, it was the influx of energised Yes voters that turned the party – which was still led by people who could remember being spat at in the street while leafletting – into a popular, mass-membership organisation that other Scottish parties feared and admired. As one senior official who worked closely with Sturgeon accepted: “We should have modernised, and we never really changed the governance to accommodate the membership post 2014. Yes there was a lack of transparency and accountability, but it’s unfair to pin everything on one person. Everyone needs to take a long hard look at themselves.” A number of sources describe a kind of institutional stasis, as the party bounced from election campaign to massive conference venue: glossy, controlled and hugely successful in public, but behind the scenes never having time to do more than triage or, increasingly, ignore longer-term issues. Repeatedly, SNP insiders point out that much of the work was done by volunteers with other responsibilities. “Restructuring takes a lot of energy, as does arranging two conferences a year and running eight election campaigns, with a small HQ team. People still don’t appreciate how difficult it was running a party during Covid. People were exhausted.” Many describe an almost passive acceptance of the highly unusual situation of having a married couple at the very top of the party. Murrell had established his reputation in transforming the party’s electoral prospects while his wife was still deputy leader, and “it didn’t seem to be a problem” when she then took over from Alex Salmond as leader and first minister. “Scottish politics is a small world,” says one veteran activist who has worked with both. But what it amounted to was a blurring of the lines between party and government. As one former MP with experience of both Salmond and Sturgeon’s leadership explains: “When we went into government in 2007, nobody had ever run anything. The lines between party and government got blurred and increasingly party machinery was co-opted into running the FM [first minister]. “After 2014 we lacked the experience and ability to run a large national party,” they add. “The leadership team were very inexperienced in handling internal democracy on that scale and increasingly steamrollered over reasonable challenge. Nobody seemed to realise there would be a mighty explosion at some point.” While the willingness to speak about it in public is certainly new, frustrations among the rank and file membership about the behaviour of the SNP leadership go back years, as do attempts to change it. That’s one of the reasons why such a substantial portion of members voted for Kate Forbes, who was narrowly beaten by Yousaf in the leadership contest, suggests another senior party figure. “They were pissed off with HQ, with emails not answered, complaints not dealt with, and above all the complacency.” Another senior official suggests that MSPs and MPs who largely endorsed Yousaf for leadership ignore this at their peril: “The split between the parliamentarians and the membership could end up being a more fundamental issue to the party’s future than the finances.” The clamour for party reform that started during the leadership contest is now deafening, but recent revelations have also galvanised some members. One central belt MSP explains: “Party members have been upset, baffled, shocked, hurt, but there’s also a new confidence in asking questions and demanding transparency from the party. They’re thinking about how to move forward, how to re-engage the people we need to, and at branch level, members are saying ‘let’s get out there, get the new leaflets ready’. There’s nothing they can do about the ongoing revelations, but they can affect what’s happening in their own constituency.” As one former minister who served with Sturgeon puts it: “The trump card was always: ‘Do you really want to do that to the boss?’ It was based on respect and trust, and a discipline based on loyalty.” So what does it mean for Yousaf, leading a party in which the internal critics are unleashed? Forbes and her campaign team have already formed a backbench group focusing on the economy, and other MSPs point to the “energy and experience” on the backbenches. “It depends if Humza is true to his word about being open to new ideas and input from beyond the inner circle,” says one. Many members note a change in tone from Yousaf. Over the Easter recess, and even with the physical demands of Ramadan fasting (Yousaf is a practising Muslim), they admire his visibility, inviting the media to Bute House for a “fireside” briefing, campaigning at weekends with activists, and emailing party members to reassure them soon after Murrell’s arrest. As one senior MSP put it: “What a difference – actually acknowledging there’s a problem.”']"
